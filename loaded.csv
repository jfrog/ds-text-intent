We have applied security patches to some edge nodes and notice the following error occurding exactly every minute. I have not seen this error. All the services are up and I was able to pull image from the edge nodes , however would like to assess and resolve this error.
The other change was that earlier in the day we also enabled replication from the upstream master repo to the edge nodes for sseveral repositories.

You should be able to test Artifactory 7.x even without  uploading anything in the demo.wftpserver.com  . There are already files  in the download folder .
Create a generic remote repository that should do just fine .

I could not succeed . I have the strong suspect is because the Wing ftp server java front page does not let the api to authenticate and access via http/https.
Does version 7.x remote repository support sftp and ftpes  protocols ?

Subject: [#183853] artifactory remote wing ftp

Hello Bruno,

Thank you for sharing that information with me.

I was operating under the assumption that this was version 7 Artifactory, in which the relevant file is indeed called "artifactory-request.log". Seeing as you are on version 6, the file will simply be called "request.log".

I was able to use the demo server sent to recreate the same behavior with the test button, however I got a message saying I did not have upload permissions when I was trying to upload files to check on whether we could download Artifacts through the generated repository.

[Screen Shot 2021-10-25 at 2.20.07 PM]

Is there any additional configuration I need to make with this server to upload and download files? I would like to see whether I can download using the rest API on this repository that I created.

Yes, you are correct. The Scan Status REST API call only needs read access. However, I don’t believe there is a way to do that within your Jenkins Pipeline using the declarative syntax. Therefore, you would need to give the jenkins user the “Manage Xray Data” permission.


Let me know if there are any questions regarding this.

Please download the logs using the below curl command and then go through the <month>-python.txt files (for example: aug-python.txt, sept-python.txt)  to know the repository usage of that particular month. I've included traffic logs as well in the zip file so that you can run the script by yourself to analyze traffic logs.

In our Production, there are 2 Artifactory nodes with 7.12.6 version and one XRay instance with version 3.17.4. The Option 1 requires for less efforts but we have concern that this may cause some loss of configuration data. If this happens is there any remediation to apply?

[ External sender. Exercise caution. ]

Hello Graeme,

In the session, we first discussed the usePresigning settings. The 5GB limit is on AWS single request limit and it can't be changed. For now, we suggest to first disabling usePresigning setting in binarystore.xml.

We also found out that there are some settings issues with buildInfo replication and after tunning the configDescriptors, we are able to replicate buildInfo.

In logs, we are still seeing many 413 request entity too large error. We have modified tomcat and nginx settings but it still didn't help. Since we noticed that the disk space is filling up more than 95%, we suggest to first trying to scale up disk space and artifactory could also throw 413 error when there's not enough diskspace.

If you still see issues after disabling presigning and with enough disk space, please reach out to us. Thank you.

Yes, that was the issue. We've fixed it!
One more question, is there a way to inject username and password in the Http Headers for Artifactory to recognize?Alternatively, I did create an "Admin Token", and set it in the "Authorization" header. It works with the requests. However, this token is too powerful. It can be used to do any operations. Can I customize a token to have read only access to repositories?
Thanks,
Jun

02s6900002PAHTeAAP5006900003K1FnrAAF[#176479] urgent : Checksum Issue upgradation of Artifactory to major versionHi Krishna,

I have tried to replicate this behavior in our lab. I have installed Artifactory version 6.5.2 and upgraded to 7.18.6. Pulled few npm packages from npm registry where by default Checksum messages gets displayed.

Testcase1:
I have not fixed the "Fix checksum" message and upgraded.
Below is the screenshot from Artifactory version 6.5.2.

Below is the screenshot from Artifactory version 7.18.6.

There is no change in the behavior.

Testcase2: I have fixed the "Fix checksum" message for another artifact and upgraded.
Below is the screenshot from Artifactory version 6.5.2.

Below is the screenshot from Artifactory version 7.18.6.

In this test also, there is no change. As upgrade does not touch this table, there would not be any changes.

I have further checked with our R&D team to check if there is a way to fix the message for all artirats.
In order to fix this message, you may run the below command to set it.
1. Stop Artifactory.
2. Take a backup of nodes tables.
3. Run the below command.

UPDATE nodes SET sha1_original='NO_ORIG' WHERE node_type = 1 and ((sha1_original IS NULL) OR (sha1_actual IS NULL) OR (sha1_original != 'NO_ORIG' AND sha1_original != sha1_actual))UPDATE nodes SET md5_original='NO_ORIG' WHERE node_type = 1 and ((md5_original IS NULL) OR (md5_actual IS NULL) OR (md5_original != 'NO_ORIG' AND md5_original != md5_actual))

4. Start Artifactory.

Note : I would like to emphasize that seeing the "Fix checksum message" is has per the design and has no affect on Artifactory's functinality as Artifactory never uses the cheskums what client published. It always depends on the cheksums what it generates during the pull from internet or push from local.

Hope this helps to overcome the message. Let us know if you have any further queries. Looking forward to your response.

02s6900002PAHUIAA55006900003jaUCAAA2[#183786] Item deploymentHello George,

There shouldn't be any difference between publishing maven artifacts in 5.x vs 7.x. Can you confirm once if the settings.xml has the correct credentials from your SaaS instance? You can check that by downloading the "settings.xml" file from the "Set Me Up" in Artifactory. Also, you can redact the password and provide me with it so that  can confirm the same.

Please let me know.

Best regards,

Hi Wendy and Team,

One thing we do notice is that the following query is not run on "SERO" instance yet:




select count(1) from node_props np where length(prop_value)>2700;

Can you send us the result when available? In the meanwhile, please confirm both artifactory versions. Again, appreciate all the help, looking forward to connecting on Thursday.

Best regards,

02s6900002PAHVGAA55006900003jaigLAAQ[#184095] federated repository failing due to following errorHi Sangamesh,

Thank you for working with me tonight. After some testing, we concluded that you have encountered a known bug with Federated Repositories and that a rolling reboot might solve the issue. Just in case, I have escalated this ticket to be reviewed by the developers.

On the call, we found the same 400 HTTP errors were encountered even if the Include/Exclude pattern was reset to "**/*". We also found that the other three Federated Repositories were not working, we tried copying an "Ubuntu" image to these Federated Repos with no luck.

I did some digging, and found that you have encountered an internal bug: RTDEV-24571 - Federated Repository is failing to propagate files from Source with 400 error on Source and Null on Destination

The suggested workaround is to try a rolling reboot of both Source and Target Artifactory, we could reboot the AWS Artifactory but not the Colo Artifactory on our call tonight. The plan is to reboot the Colo Artifactory at around 9 PM PST.

In the meantime I am escalating this ticket to get further steps to try. Expect an update from us soon with regards to the escalation, please let me know if the reboot helps or does not.

Best regards,
Patrick Russell

Hi Ken,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support. I have reviewed the error messages that you sent with the initial response to the case, but I could not confirm what is causing the issue without reviewing the logs in full.

Can you send me a copy of the logs from both servers?

The logs can be found in the  following location:

I would recommend zipping the folder and sending the zip files to the following site:

This is Farhaan Patel, a member of the CTI team at Roku. We are in the final phase of migrating to artifactory ha (running on K8's) backed by S3. I wanted to confirm the artifactory support for S3 life cycle rules like migrating the artifact to AWS Glacier (cold storage) if it's not downloaded in a specified period of time and putting it back to S3 if the user requests it at any point of time. 
All we have done is defined it into the meta data and properties of the S3 bucket. Is there anything else we need to consider to achieve this from the stand point of making any changes to values.yaml? FYI, we are running on 7.x version, the latest version of artifactory.
Hoping to hear from you soon.
Regards,Farhaan.

02s6900002PAHWnAAP5006900003jajBdAAIRe: [#184121] Function with content browser of POM/XML file  instead of file downloadHi Team,
As you know we migrated from Nexus to Artifactory week ago, our users are asking for another feature which NEXUS supported but Artifactory not.
When we access POM or XML file before, we can see the full content on browser（Nexus) instead of file download(Artifactory), it is inconvenient for debug build issue now, could you please let us know how to achieve the feature from Artifactory side? Attached screenshot for Nexus.
ThanksYi

This is Farhaan Patel, a member of the CTI team at Roku. We are migrating from artifactory to HA installation and wanted to use S3 with eventual-less caching. For the same reason, we are using the persistance type aws-s3-v3.
Here is the snippet of the code from values.yaml file as shown as wanted to confirm what we are doing is correct.
awsS3V3:
 bucketName: artifactory-bucket
 cloudFrontDomainName: null
 cloudFrontKeyPairId: null
 cloudFrontPrivateKey: null
 enablePathStyleAccess: false
 enableSignedUrlRedirect: false
 endpoint: http://s3.amazonaws.com

 maxConnections: 50
 path: /
 region: us-west-2
 signatureExpirySeconds: 300
 testConnection: false
 useInstanceCredentials: true
 usePresigning: false
 useSignature: true
 We are not passing aws-creds as we are using SA for the same. Please let us know, is this the only thing we need to do for eventual-less caching or is there any thing else associated to this.
Hoping to hear from you soon.
Regards,Farhaan.

02s6900002PAHYKAA55006900003YgF1AAAV[#183333] Getting manifest unknown: The named manifest is not known to the registry error when trying to pull images from Dockerhub via ArtifactoryHello Akash,

Thank you for joining me in a session today.

In our session, we reviewed the issue and tried a few things to get a better understanding of what may be causing the docker requests to not be sent with credentials.
We tried some manual curl commands to obtain the docker token and saw that we were able to retrieve and pull images as expected with the token/user.

The only mentioned networking object in between the docker client and the Artifactory instance was a Netscaler Load Balancer.

When we attempted to perform a docker login through the HA URL (through the Load Balancer) we see on Artifactory's side that the credentials are not sent and the user is being read as anonymous.

We were able to test the IP of the Artifactory instance directly to art1. The IP was added as an insecure registry in the docker daemon and the pull succeeded with credentials to docker-hub repository.
At first, we saw that no logs were being written to art1 but we found that the logback.xml was mis-modified so we added the logback.xml from art2 which was working and we saw the docker logs with the user as expected.

We further tested the HA URL by shutting down art2 so the traffic gets redirected to art1 and saw that docker requests were being read as anonymous in art1.


There is not anything wrong with the Artifactory configurations and Artifactory is working properly. The Load Balancer is causing the issue and we suspect that the credentials are getting stripped there (i.e. maybe some header is being removed).


To investigate further we will need to look at the Load Balancer configuration to see what it may be doing to cause this issue. Akash mentioned that this is being managed by another team and getting the information may take some time. I will await this information.
I will also let you know if I discover anything that may point to what in Netscaler may be causing this but for further investigation, more information from Netscaler will be needed.

Derek Pang

        worker_connections 20000; 2. Increase from 768 to 20000
        # multi_accept on;
}



  *   Also making 2 changes in ‘artifactory.conf’ to increase buffers and sizes to

    proxy_buffer_size 256k;   # Double it from 128k;
    proxy_buffers 40 256k;     # Too, double it from 128k;

Hello Minh,

Sure thing. Thank you for the confirmation. I will await the logs whenever you are able to send them. Before sending the logs I would like to request that the test be repeated again to generate fresh logs if possible. Thanks!

02s6900002PAHZ3AAP5006900003jajB9AAI[#184119] Member node not starting after Artifactory upgrade: Service registry ping failedHi Ian,

Thank you for joining the meeting with us on short notice.

From the artifactory-service.log file, since the error "Error while trying to connect to local router at address 'http://localhost:8046/access':connection refused" is the only indication, we suspected that the port 8046 is available for service but the service couldn't get to listen at the particular port which could have occurred due to existing old process IDs.

So, we have decided to perform a clean restart of the service and observed the member node coming up after the restart. We were able to access the Artifactory member node.

However, we have observed the primary node is not available while we were troubleshooting the member node issue. You have checked with the team internally and confirmed that there were some changes done in regards to permissions on the primary node by the team. While trying to perform a restart of the primary node, it returned a 'permission denied' error and from the artifactory-service.log, we observed an 'access denied' error against a particular access-client library file.

Caused by: java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException: D:\jfrog\artifactory\app\artifactory\tomcat\webapps\artifactory\WEB-INF\lib\access-client-api-7.17.2.jar
at java.base/sun.nio.fs.WindowsException.translateToIOException(WindowsException.java:89)

We have compared the permissions assigned to the files in specific between the working and the non-working instances and it appeared to be the same. As we couldn't get to the root cause of the issue on the primary node, you have confirmed that you will get in touch with the team internally to verify the permissions.

We would mark this support case as closed, if any further assistance is needed in the future, you may always reach out to JFrog Support. Thank you once again for your patience and understanding.

Instead of using virtual repository in their nuget.config, will it be better if we add the link to the nuget local and remote directly in their nuget.config ?

"Another possible workaround is configuring the Nuget client to use the V3 protocol instead of the default V2."

è Why this will work ? Any explanation ?

Subject: [#183569] Big problem with nuget virtual repository


Hello Tan Wai Loon,

Thank you for waiting while I was checking on this matter internally.

The possible workaround is setting the concerned Nuget remote repository to be 'offline'  ( link<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Remote+Repositories#:~:text=URLs%20are%20supported.-,Offline,-If%20set%2C%20this> ) so the request triggered for resolving the Nuget packages will not be reaching the upstream remote repository and will be looking for the packages within the cached files.  However, it might cause some issues when builds depend on newer versions that are not cached.  Another possible workaround is configuring the Nuget client to use the V3 protocol instead of the default V2.

I hope this information addressed your query. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions, I will be happy to assist you.

Looking forward to your response.

02s6900002PAHakAAH5006900003jaixbAAA[#184108] JFROG Xray blocking low and medium vulnerabilitiesHello Nate,

Thank you for joining me in a session today.

In our session, we saw that for the artifacts being blocked Xray was blocking them not because of the violations but because they were being read as unscanned. After we disabled the policy set to block unscanned we saw that we could download the artifact.

Blocking unscanned, however, is a requirement. So we investigated deeper into this.

We found that reindexing the artifacts manually through the rest API endpoint here resolved the issue but because there were many artifacts it is not feasible to do this one by one.

There is no way to reindex an entire repository so we had to look for alternatives. One proposed workaround was to delete all the artifacts in the repository and recopy them so that they would be removed from the database and reindexed when they were copied back. You will be performing this operation and getting back to me. (Note please allow some time after deleting the artifacts before recopying them in for the database to remove the entries in the backend)

If this solution does not work we will have to look at running an external script. Let me know how the test goes.

Best regards,
Derek Pang

02s6900002PAHauAAH5006900003jajDeAAIRe: [#184124] Artifactory returning 500 errors periodicallyPeriodically, we'll have users report that Artifactory is down. Upon browsing to the UI, we'll receive a "friendly" 500 error message (from Artifactory UI, not a direct 500 from the web server). The only way we've found to resolve this is to restart the Artifactory service (one at a time) on each of the cluster nodes. Once all service instances have been restarted, the system functions normally again. The frequency of this greatly varies. Sometimes, it happens once a week. Sometimes, everything will be fine for a month. However, the issue always eventually recurs, and we'd like to get to the root of it / solve it. Please let me know what additional information you need from me to troubleshoot. Thank you!

02s6900002PAHbYAAX5006900003jai8rAAA[#184070] upgrade from 7.21.8 to 7.24.6Hello Shawn, Kyle, and Soham,

Thank you for joining me in a session today.
In our session, we looked closer at this issue. We found that metadata being returned for a particular package contained an incorrect URL containing "_relative" when retrieved from the virtual repository.

There was another Artifactory instance, engineering, but we were unable to replicate the issue there and it functioned as expected without a 404 on the npm install command.

We noticed that the package.json in the .npm repository did later contain the correct URLs but the URL retrieved from the api/npm endpoint still contained the "_relative" url.

I believe that you may be running into RTDEV-24405, 'Cover additional NPM "_relative"-specific cases', an internal JIRA where the '_relative' rewrite was not occurring properly for the metadata and resulting in 404s like we saw in our session.
This JIRA fix was released in a later Artifactory version 7.27.X.

As updating Artifactory is not possible without prior planning and baking we went ahead with a workaround to get your developers unblocked.

We created a local npm repository containing the package (and all of its versions). We added it to priority resolution and to the npm virtual repository. After this, we were able to resolve the npm packages without issue.

We only noted that the issue was happening with the 'adp-react-components' package and its versions so we only copied those artifacts from the remote repository but the same workaround can be done if you encounter this issue for other packages.

Let me know if you have any further questions regarding this ticket or if you are able to plan an update for Artifactory to the latest 7.27.X to see if this resolves the issue or if it does not, to continue troubleshooting the cause.

Glad to hear that fixed it (the URL on UI download).

In regards to the other question, yep as you can found out for some rest calls you can encode the username/password in the header.
You can also look into Access Tokens (which are generated through Rest API) which have limited permissions and are not just admins. (More information here).

02s6900002PAHdFAAX5006900003YgHeiAAF[#183421] Okta authentication with API key does not work for fetching artifacts for non-admin usersHello Lars,

Thank you for confirming. I have marked this case as closed. However, I would like to mention that with the current situation that you have, it is required a manual intervention for the Rest API to work. You have to manually assign the SAML users to the groups so that the users, groups, and permission target association takes effect and you should be able to download the packages.

There is another workaround. You can follow this KB article - https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/how-to-map-a-saml-sso-user-to-a-ldap-group/ where you can map the SAML users to the LDAP group as LDAP groups can be synced with the Artifactory. However, this is just a workaround. The fix is to use the feature SCIM.

I have marked this case as closed. However, please feel free to reach out to us for any queries and concerns in the future. We will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for reaching JFrog Support.
With regards to your query on disabling port 80 at the load balancer level, you may prefer updating the active listeners on the NLB by removing port 80 on the load balancer configuration.

Screenshot:

Also, please update the values.yaml file in order to update the backend protocol with https on the annotations and disable the http section for port 80 which will help to achieve your usecase.

Example:
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: https

nginx:
enabled: true
http:
enabled: false
externalPort: 80
internalPort: 80

I hope the above information will be helpful to you.

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog support.

With regard to the reported issue, we would request you to share the below details in order to investigate the issue further.

1. Since when you started noticing this behavior, were there any recent changes with respect to Artifactory or the repository setting?

2. Let us know if you are able to download the same docker images via Artifactory which is not getting cached?

3. Create a new docker remote repository, pull a docker image that is getting cached and not getting cached in remote-cache, and share the docker command along with the complete output of both the use case.

4. Reproduce the issue and provide us with the exact time of the event and the latest support bundle. This can be achieved from the Artifactory UI →  Admin → Advanced → Support zone → Create a new support bundle. Ensure that all of the boxes are checked then click "OK". You may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:

$ curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184001/" *No username and password are required.

I need to schedule a meeting on coming Friday 06:00 – 06:30 PM IST .

Note :

We have decided to have one meeting with you , my AD team and SSO service provider to have a common understating about the configuration. So still I didn’t make any implementation on our owner environment.

May be during our meeting we can try implement it on my DEV system with help of all yours.

Sorry I have not gotten back to you.  Busy like a bee.

So yes, I am still having issues.

I can perform a conan search with no issues.

The issue I was having with logging in or uploading.  Anything that requires credentials.

What I found was that on windows, I can not use git bash to run these type of commands.

Once I use the command prompt, it works just fine.

02s6900002PAHehAAH5006900003YdfsDAARRe: [#181398] Support on artifactory configuration reset issueHi Farnoosh,



Sorry about the slow reply;



I ran into multiple separate issues, but I think removing the DataDir value worked.

For the gist of it (after removing the postgresqlDataDir value), the postgres database had trouble starting up after a pod restart after an import. It looked like also user/groups/permissions were unable to be imported. I knew we were using a different postgres database docker image than the default one in the helm chart, so I revised it to use the default bitnami/postgresql database image. That allowed it to boot up the first time, but then was unable to boot up again after a pod restart. What I ended up doing was deleting the postgresql PVC, and reinstalling the helm chart again. I then did the system restore with a backup. This seemed to have worked. The postgresql database and artifactory seem to reboot fine from a short test we did tonight.



Tl;dr: It looks good so far. The settings stayed after a few reboot reproduction attempts.



FYI, We are not using the latest helm chart version though, but that can be considered for a later time.



Thanks for the help.

Hello Tony,

I wanted to follow up with you regarding the Artifactory configuration reset issue, since we last spoke on the support session.

Were you able to perform the two suggested tests which were fixing the path to the correct persistent volume by removing the postgresqlDataDir: "/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata" line from the values.yaml and checking the Config Descriptor?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Currently, there is not another way to upload a support bundle. (As currently uploading through UI to the supportlogs.jfrog.com is currently blocked).

It looks like your network may be restricted or blocking https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/.



Taking a look at the logs sent I see that the last two curls are outputting the error for fxbooking-nuget and fxstp-nuget. It looks like the issue may come from these repositories.

Are these virtual or remote repositories?

As a test, you can create a temporary virtual without these two repositories and see if the nuget resolution succeeds.
We may need to dive into these repositories as well to find the conflict.

FYI- All nodes are now working...
1.We made changes to permissions on the folders for the Artifactory installation and saw that this broke the Artifactory service.
2.We reverted the changes, but the service on the primary node still wouldn't start.
3.What we found was that we needed to open each folder where permissions were reverted, before the update was actually applied.  Once this was done, the changes were fully reverted and the service started as expected.

CAUTION EXTERNAL EMAIL: This email originated from outside of the organization. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe.

Hi Ian,

Thank you for joining the meeting with us on short notice.

From the artifactory-service.log file, since the error "Error while trying to connect to local router at address 'http://localhost:8046/access':connection refused" is the only indication, we suspected that the port 8046 is available for service but the service couldn't get to listen at the particular port which could have occurred due to existing old process IDs.

So, we have decided to perform a clean restart of the service and observed the member node coming up after the restart. We were able to access the Artifactory member node.

However, we have observed the primary node is not available while we were troubleshooting the member node issue. You have checked with the team internally and confirmed that there were some changes done in regards to permissions on the primary node by the team. While trying to perform a restart of the primary node, it returned a 'permission denied' error and from the artifactory-service.log, we observed an 'access denied' error against a particular access-client library file.

Caused by: java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException: D:\jfrog\artifactory\app\artifactory\tomcat\webapps\artifactory\WEB-INF\lib\access-client-api-7.17.2.jar
at java.base/sun.nio.fs.WindowsException.translateToIOException(WindowsException.java:89)

We have compared the permissions assigned to the files in specific between the working and the non-working instances and it appeared to be the same. As we couldn't get to the root cause of the issue on the primary node, you have confirmed that you will get in touch with the team internally to verify the permissions.

We would mark this support case as closed, if any further assistance is needed in the future, you may always reach out to JFrog Support. Thank you once again for your patience and understanding.

Thank you for the information.

The HTTP logs that I went through in suggested the mentioned files were causing the issue in starting the sync.

Would you mind checking for the two mentioned files?
In https://artifacts-dev.apps.mt-d8.belv.gkp.jpmchase.net's binarystore:

In the meantime I'm running a few tests on my side to see if I can replicate the issue. I'll send you an update on my troubleshooting by the end of this week at the latest.

02s6900002PAHgxAAH5006900003Yf9TSAAZ[#182371] JMX monitoringHi Pavel,

I would like to keep you posted on the ticket. I further tried to replicate the use-case in my lab environment and I was not able to reproduce the issue.

Reproduction Environment details:

1. Artifactory version ->  7.24.3.

2. The OS version -> ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.

3. The installation type -> Debian ->  https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Installing+Artifactory#InstallingArtifactory-DebianInstallation

4. Added the java options in the system.yaml file configuration.

shared:
  extraJavaOpts: "-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9010 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=true -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=ARTIFACTORY_HOST_IP"

5. Used the default JDK:

The customer is using the below environment.

As a next step, we need to concentrate on the following steps.

1. Please let us know the exact steps you have followed to install the Artifactory. Did you use Debian installation or Linux archive installation? Please clarify, if possible share the complete set of commands used in your lower environment to install the Artifactory. The reason I am asking this question is because we were able to list 9010 port when we start the Artifacfactory manually and the issue is observed only when we do Service startup.

2. When you start the service (systemctl start artifactory.service) we execute the following script:

/opt/jfrog/artifactory/app/bin/artifactoryManage.sh start

We need to investigate what's the difference between artifactoryManage.sh start and artifactory.sh start in terms of loading JAVA OPTS.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for being patient with us while I was working with our product team.

I have an update on the reported behavior of backups as the functionality was working as expected in Artifactory v7.25 and above the issue will not be implemented/fixed in v6.x. Hence I would recommend you to process with Artifactory upgrade to the latest Artifactory v7.x in order to overcome the reported issue.

I hope this information will be helpful, please advise if you have additional questions on this matter.

Yes, I saw your response. Unfortunately, it does not help us as you may be aware that Artifactory v2.6.6 is really old and upgrading from Artifactory v2.6.6 to Artifactory v7.x is complicated and probably not supported. Also, it is not something that we want to undertake just to get past a "potential" security threat in Tomcat within our secure VPN.
We're currently looking at a solution involving a more modern nginx frontend talking to this legacy Artifactory v2.6.6 instance. Let me know if you have any suggestions w.r.t. this setup.

Thanks for your reply. So, if we are using LDAP groups, can you confirm that we will not see any Users in the list below?
We will essentially have to define one LDAP group for each Project-Role combination, and import that into Artifactory.   And then assign that LDAP Group a role: every user in that group will get that role.
This dialog box will not show a list of users that are in a Group.

Please confirm my understanding. Thanks.

Subject: [#183859] Question on Project User List

***EXTERNAL EMAIL ALERT – EXERCISE CAUTION***
Hi Dean,

Thanks for reaching out to JFrog Support. If my understanding of your question is correct, your projects will be assigned to your LDAP group(s) rather than individual repositories within the project, and instead the groups will be allocated a 'role' within each project. I did a quick test regarding being able to see the user list if a group in which a user is part of, is added to a project. Users of the groups can have access to multiple projects this way. I granted my test group with different level roles within two  different projects without any issues. The read/write permissions were preserved as well.

I don't believe it will directly show the user in the 'users list' - only the group is listed in the UI/REST: see the below API example:


% curl localhost:8082/access/api/v1/projects/paul/users -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"

{

  "members" : [ {

    "name" : "test123",

    "roles" : [ "Project Admin" ]

  }, {

    "name" : "proj-dev-test",

    "roles" : [ "Viewer" ]

  } ]

}%


% curl localhost:8082/access/api/v1/projects/paul/groups/project-group-test -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

{

  "name" : "project-group-test",

  "roles" : [ "Viewer" ]

}%

project-group-test contains another user named 'testperson' and 'read-only':


% curl "localhost:8082/artifactory/api/security/groups/project-group-test?includeUsers=true" -u admin:password

{

  "name" : "project-group-test",

  "autoJoin" : false,

  "realm" : "internal",

  "adminPrivileges" : false,

  "policyManager" : false,

  "watchManager" : false,

Thank you for writing back to us.
I'm sorry I missed sharing the information earlier. In order to vote/watch in the Jira portal, we require different access/credentials to the portal apart from the support portal.  I would request you to signup/register for the portal JIRA here and vote/watch the RTFACT-20557 available for public reviewel.

Let me know if you require further assistance on this matter.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
In Saas we only support Repository path method for docker repository. I recommend you to go through our confluence page here for further reference.
So docker login/pull/push commands would be as below.

docker login straumann.jfrog.io

docker pull straumann.jfrog.io/docker-straumann-generic/<imagename>

docker tag  straumann.jfrog.io/docker-straumann-generic/<image-name>

docker push straumann.jfrog.io/docker-straumann-generic/<image-name>


Same works for other docker repositories in straumann.jfrog.io instance. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.

02s6900002PAHn0AAH5006900003jaUSNAA2RE: [#183808] UST SmartOps - optimization calculationHi Soly,

"The binary size displayed is the storage occupied IF there was no deduplication. The artifact size is the true amount of storage occupied in the binarystore (the filesystem physically storing the artifacts)."

If this is the case, I wonder why the storage watermark used the binary size (which is hypothetical) and not the artifact size (which is real).

[cid:image002.png@01D7CA53.24538A70]

Artifact size never went above 1.5 GB throughout this month. The graph above from billing portal exactly reflected the binary size reported for each day. I hope the billing will be based on actual usage and not hypothetical usage.

Raman

Hello Raman,

The checksum based storage functions as a method of deduplication.

The binary size displayed is the storage occupied IF there was no deduplication. The artifact size is the true amount of storage occupied in the binarystore (the filesystem physically storing the artifacts).

So if you have a 100MB artifact in two repositories your binary size would show 200MB but since both repositories refer to the same artifact in the binarystore your artifact size is only 100MB.

Please feel free to let us know if there are any questions regarding this.

Soly Im

This is an intended behaviour as you have Anonymous access enabled at General Security Configuration.



If you disable this setting, then you will get below output after running the first test url.

The REST API calls are basically to do a health check of the end point, if you allow anonymous access REST API calls simply pass through Artifactory and get you the response without authentication.

Hope the above details clarify the issue, do let me know if you have any further questions on the case?

Looking forward to your response.

02s6900002PAHppAAH5006900003jadDvAAI[#183995] Error on fresh podman installationHello Philip,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to your query, we could observe many propagation issues, usually indicating a connection issue between the nodes. Wherein the primary is not able to communicate with the member node's filestore.

Error propagating event: syncStorageUsage: Read timed out
java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out
Error propagating syncStorageUsage. reason : Propagation for event syncStorageUsage to the following servers failed: [art-lsp8101a, art-lsp8102a]

Could you please try to stop all the nodes and then restart the primary node, followed by other nodes and see if you are still experiencing the issue. Also confirm if you are able to access the Artifactory through the UI. If yes, please send the screenshot of service status page under Administration | Monitoring | service status.

In case of these errors, I would recommend you to run the below command which will give us complete health of all services involved in the platform.

curl -s http://localhost:8046/router/api/v1/topology/health

we would need a few more information from your current environment which will help to further investigate the issue

Could you confirm if you are currently using a common mount point to share the $JFROG_HOME directory between the HA nodes, if so, it is recommended to have the local filesystem for individual nodes. Please confirm.
Along with the above information, please zip the $JFROG_HOME/var folder of all three nodes and

you may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the below command:

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/183995/"

Looking forward to your response.

02s6900002PAHq9AAH5006900003jabOPAAY[#183972] Missing artifacts after DR migrationHi Raghu and Team,

Thank you for joining the session.

Over the call we have discussed on below issues related to the Pypi repository:

1. Timed-out error while downloading the PyPI packages from the remote repository. We have increased the socket timeout at the PyPI remote repository and we tried retrieving the packages which were successful.

2. We see an issue when a user tries to install a Shapely PyPI package(without version) it is retrieving an older version1.7.1. However, when passing the version we see No matching distribution found for Shapely==1.8.0 error. We then tried installing the same package by configuring the PyPI client with the direct remote registry URL(bypassing the Artifactory). We see the behavior is the same. Hence this could be due to the issue at the registry/client end. And in the end, you have confirmed that another user with a different PyPI client version was able to install the same, hence you agreed to check on this tomorrow.

3. Observing Lock on LockEntryId errors while performing the ZapCache on the PyPI remote repository, however, you were able to perform the same on other remote repositories. For which you agreed to work internally and get back to us for any further assistance required on this regard.

02s6900002PAHqdAAH5006900003jaeGaAAI[#184004] npm package corrupted dataHi Etamar,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to the reported issue with NPM install, it could occur due to various reasons like missing sha1 value in the package.json file or the file might be duplicated/corrupted. And also It could be the reason that there is another NPM package with the same name/version but a different checksum than the one attempting to be installed, which is causing this error.

A good way to verify if the binary file in Artifactory is corrupted or not is to manually download the npm file and compare its checksum with Artifactory.  You can run a "sha1sum" on the downloaded file and compare its output with the checksum of the NPM client and the checksum on Artifactory's UI for the particular package:


Example sha1sum for esutils-2.0.3.tgz  package is "74d2eb4de0b8da1293711910d50775b9b710ef64".

If it is happening for a particular package while pulling from the remote repository, try to delete the package from the cache, perform Zap cache by right-clicking on the remote repository cache and let us know your observation.

If the issue still persists, we would request you to share the below details in order to investigate the issue further.

1. Let us know if this is happening on a particular package or all other packages in that repository?

2. What is the repository type (npm-local, remote or virtual) in which you are encountering this behavior.

3.  Reproduce the issue and also share the complete verbose output and log generated by the NPM client for this failure? You can generate this by running the command with a --verbose flag, which will generate additional output and a debug log.

4. Once the issue is reproduced, share the Artifactory latest support bundle and It would be helpful if you could note the time of the reproduction from the logs and share it with me in this ticket.

Looking forward to your response.

Janardhana JL

Thank you for getting back to us.

Q1. There was a system proxy applied that was preventing the communication between the artifactory nodes and after removing that, I don't see the event propagation errors now in the logs.

[JFROG] I am glad that you are able to figure out the issue from your end on the event propagation issue where the issue was fixed after removing the system proxy applied that was preventing the communication between the Artifactory nodes.

Q2. But even restarting both Artifactory and Xray servers, Xray seems to be paired with only one node in the HA cluster.

[JFROG] Do you have a load balancer URL configured for Artifactory nodes? If yes, what was the jfrog url and the join.key provided while installing Xray. Please elaborate.

Q3. Xray DB sync.

[JFROG] Regarding your query on Xray DB sync, please note that I have created a new ticket: 184128 and assigned it to my name. As per our company policy, different issues has to be handled in different tickets so that it would be easier for us to track the issues. I will respond to you in the new ticket on Xray DB sync issue.

Looking forward to your response.

02s6900002PAHuBAAX5006900003YgZSQAA3Re: [#183706] Duplicate Artifactory licenses on JPDsShilpa,

While gathering information for this ticket. I discovered why we were seeing the duplicate licenses and license expires in 0 days messages. The license file contains both old and new licenses and there were duplicates among all 6 of the services and their license files. After an inventory was made of the artifactory.cluster.license and artifactory.lic files I was able to cut and paste between files to correct all of the issues. Doing this I able to avoid stopping the services to release the licenses.

I suspect the remaining question would be how the licenses got in this situation.  I used the License Bucket UI to assign the licenses, but as I explained in the ticket I saw multiple errors when assigning files.

Hi Stan

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.
Can you kindly share the artifactory.cluster.license file under $JFROG_HOME/var/etc/artifactory with us? Also., kindly share the complete logs from MC as well as Artifactory instances so that we can debug if there is any other cause of this behaviour. Send us the bundle using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:

02s6900002PAHvdAAH5006900003MmXEaAAN[#177541] Docker images not scanned and a lot of errorsHi Andreas,

Thank you for your patience.

We further tested the use case in our lab environment by building the multi architecture Docker image following the below Article.

https://jfrog.com/blog/the-more-the-merrier-multi-arch-docker-manifests-with-buildx-and-artifactory/

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/multi-arch/

Once the image is built we pushed to Artifactory and indexed using Xray which was successful with a 100 % result.



With a valid multi-architecture docker image we were able to scan the image successfully, and we did not observe any error message as below as we can see in your use case.

2021-10-06T06:23:11.835Z [33m[jfxid][0m [31m[WARN ][0m [ ] [docker:36] [main  ] Failed to unmarshal manifest.json file to docker manifest format,file will be ignored

Hence, We would like to scan and test the docker image which you are currently having to investigate the issue further. May I know if you could share a few of the docker images from the faulty repository to test the scenario and also if possible steps followed by your team to build these images?

You can share a few sample images by compressing the docker image using the docker save command. For more information you can refer to this article you can save the images as a tar archive and share it with us.

We look forward to your response.

Janardhana JL

I have parsed over the given log file and could see the below errors related to the ‘security.import.xml” file.

Caused by: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: An error has occurred while deserializing the file /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/security.import.xml. Please assure it's validity or remove it from the 'etc' folder.

From the above error message, we could see that there is a file named security.import.xml in  /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory directory. During startup, when there is a configuration file that includes the name ‘import’ tells Artifactory to override the current configuration file from the database. In order to overcome this issue, I would request you to move this ‘security.import.xml’ file to a different location ( as a backup ) from the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory directory.  After making this change, please ensure that all the microservices are down and then start the Artifatory application again.

Please try the above suggested step and let us know the outcome of it. Looking forward to your response.

Subject: [#183990] Need only 443 port for JFrog NLB


[**EXTERNAL EMAIL**]
Hi Prajwal,

Thank you for reaching JFrog Support.
With regards to your query on disabling port 80 at the load balancer level, you may prefer updating the active listeners on the NLB by removing port 80 on the load balancer configuration.

Screenshot:
[Image_2021-10-26_08-59-10.png]
Also, please update the values.yaml file in order to update the backend protocol with https on the annotations and disable the http section for port 80 which will help to achieve your usecase.

Example:
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: https

nginx:
   enabled: true
   http:
       enabled: false
       externalPort: 80
       internalPort: 80

I hope the above information will be helpful to you.

Are you able to explain why this has started happening?
When we originally moved to this specific version of artifactory we did not have this issue. The security.import.xml is a mechanism we have always used and this has not been changed in multiple version upgrades since 6.x.

Hi Vijay

Thank you for sharing the logs with me. From the shared rabbitmq log I could only see that there is an issue with the user Xray to make changes in the database. Can you kindly confirm how was the database installed? Also, were there any recent changes done to the user on Artifactory/Xray/Database that might have caused this issue?

Hello Aaron,

Nice to meet you. I will be assisting with this issue.

Could you let me know what version of Artifactory this is occurring on?

Please also navigate to the build-info repository where this build is stored and send me the SHA-1 value of the build info json file for the Wizsteps build and build number 'dev_2021-10-16_0855.12659'
[cid:image002.png@01D7CA42.A9F95120]

After obtaining the SHA 1 value and sending it to me please head over to the filestore and navigate to this file.
It will be located in the filestore under the directory with the first two letters of the SHA1 value.
For example, 0f1d12833c43ed7d0163e1d98d79482c72d40729 would be located at ($Art_Home/data/artifactory/filestore/0f/0f1d12833c43ed7d0163e1d98d79482c72d40729).
Filestore location may differ depending on how the binarystore was configured. (for example it may be in an s3 bucket instead of locally stored).

Then please go ahead and send this file to me.
You can then send me the file with the curl command: curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/183662/"

We have a JFrog Artifactory successfully connected to a Postgresql cloud cluster using Automatic master host selection feature in connect string: jdbc:postgresql://host1:6432,host2:6432,host3:6432/artifactory?&targetServerType=master&ssl=true&sslmode=verify-full
According to the Documentation for JFrog XRay https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Xray+System+YAMLIt is unclear how to connect the xray instance using the same mechanism.
Here is the cloud provider's documentationhttps://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/managed-postgresql/operations/connect#automatic-master-host-selection
We have 3 database servers: 1 master + 2 slaves. Failover may occur anytime at providers side. So we need always-working DB connection
The only connection string that works is: postgres://c-<cluster_id>.rw.mdb.yandexcloud.net:6432/xray?&targetServerType=master&ssl=true&sslrootcert=/opt/jfrog/xray/.postgresql/root.crt&sslmode=verify-full
But in this way we'll definitely have service disruption while database failover against DNS TTL + XRay's internal timers for resolving the database hostname.
Please, provide the JFrog engineer's way to use targetServerType feature.
==Regards,Evgeny Litvinov

Subject: Artifactory Layouts and Repository structure requirement
Importance: High

HI All,

Here it is the process step that we have to follow for end to end deployment

  *   Teamcity will pickup the changes and generate the msi packages
  *   Msi will be zipped and it should to be deployed to JFrog Artifactory server (Not sure which repository layout I must use)
  *   Once the package is pushed to Artifactory, Octopus deploy will pickup the msi file and deploy to deployment target.
     *   Octopus does support only Nugget and Maven formats.

Questions:

  *   What is the suitable repository type I must choose in JFrog
  *   What layout I must use to deploy selected repository

We are new to this implementatin, appriciate if you can take remote and provide the steps to automate our requirement during IST hours.

02s6900002PAI6bAAH5006900003jajT3AAIFW: Artifactory Layouts and Repository structure requirementAppreciate your early response on the below requirement.

From: Gadamsetty, Venkata Hari Krishna
Sent: Monday, October 25, 2021 6:08 PM
To: JFrog Support <support@jfrog.com>
Subject: Artifactory Layouts and Repository structure requirement
Importance: High

HI All,

Here it is the process step that we have to follow for end to end deployment

  *   Teamcity will pickup the changes and generate the msi packages
  *   Msi will be zipped and it should to be deployed to JFrog Artifactory server (Not sure which repository layout I must use)
  *   Once the package is pushed to Artifactory, Octopus deploy will pickup the msi file and deploy to deployment target.
     *   Octopus does support only Nugget and Maven formats.

Questions:

  *   What is the suitable repository type I must choose in JFrog
  *   What layout I must use to deploy selected repository

We are new to this implementatin, appriciate if you can take remote and provide the steps to automate our requirement during IST hours.

02s6900002PAI7ZAAX5006900003jajK1AAI[#184128] Xray DB sync stuckHi Rangarajan,

To investigate the issue reported concerning Xray DB sync, we would like to gather a few more details along with complete logs of Xray which will be helpful to troubleshoot and understand the root cause of this behaviour.

1. Please let us know the DISK size, memory and IOPS allocated for the PostgreSQL database, could you please check if the allocated storage meets the Minimal requirements for the node running PostgreSQL as mentioned in our wiki page for Xray? If not, we request you to increase the storage allocated for the PostgreSQL database. Below is the recommendation for the PostgreSQL database.

>> 4 CPU cores,

>> 30 GB of RAM

>> 300 GB disk

>> 3000 IOPS value

2. If you are using a firewall, to allow the database sync to complete successfully, you need to add the following URLs to your firewall’s whitelist:

1. https://releases.jfrog.io/
2. https://releases-cdn.jfrog.io
3. https://dl.bintray.com/
4. https://akamai.bintray.com
5. https://jxray.jfrog.io

Please confirm if you have whitelisted all the above URLs.

3. Enable debug logging for Xray, please add the following snippet to your system.yaml file (located in $JFROG_HOME/Xray/var/etc/)

server:

    logging:

        application:

            level: debug

>>After applying changes and abort the DBsync from UI, then perform a restart of Xray, resume the sync, and eventually, the daily sync should be triggering in the backend.

4. Once the DBsync is started, share the latest logs by generating a new Xray support bundle and the output of the screenshot of the below directories.

Directories:

>>ls -ltr $JFROG_HOME/var/work/server/updates/component

>>ls -ltr $JFROG_HOME/var/work/server/updates/vulnerabilities


5. Also, share us with the output of the updates table by accessing the Xray's PostgreSQL database

select * from updates;


You may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account using the below command:

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184128/"


Looking forward to hearing back from you.

We're in the process of moving the Artifactory DB to new dedicated servers in the datacenter. I found that these problems correlate to periods of high load on the DB servers caused by other applications. The load isn't remarkably high, but it's possible that we've hit some other bottlenck in the network or IO that caused this. We will move Artifactory to dedicated servers and hope that this solves our problems.
It's OK to close this ticket. If the move does not solve our problems, I'll open a new ticket.
Thank you for the support.

We are planning that  in 2-3  years size of storage reach  70Tb and size of DB PostgreSQL to 3 TB

To reduce load on the server and reduce risks of loss data we have several questions:

1. Is there any option to balance load between several DB or divide into several instances of DB?

2.  Is there any option to use several instances Artifactory behind load balancer with different set of repos and using the same URL?

[**EXTERNAL EMAIL**]
Hi Prajwal,

Thank you for reaching JFrog Support.
With regards to your query on disabling port 80 at the load balancer level, you may prefer updating the active listeners on the NLB by removing port 80 on the load balancer configuration.

Screenshot:
[Image_2021-10-26_08-59-10.png]
Also, please update the values.yaml file in order to update the backend protocol with https on the annotations and disable the http section for port 80 which will help to achieve your usecase.

Example:
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: https

nginx:
   enabled: true
   http:
       enabled: false
       externalPort: 80
       internalPort: 80

I hope the above information will be helpful to you.

The error usually occurs when the primary node tries contacting the member node s3 to make a connection, however, it might not establish a connection at that point of time where the member node is still booting up or unresponsive due to the heavy loads or something else. You need to check the resource monitoring graph of CPU/JVM Memory/Thread/DB pool status at that time for secondary_nodel instance. As you are aware this error will not cause any issue. Hence you may safely ignore the error.

Hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any other questions.

As per the documentation, HTTP Requests Are No Longer Supported: as part of hardening our cloud security policy in the JFrog Platform, we no longer support non-secure HTTP traffic requests and have enabled HSTS strict headers which will cause all HTTP requests (including browsers) to be automatically redirected to HTTPS.

We further worked internally and verified the shared logs, unfortunately, we could not find much evidence on this issue why it isn't using the environment variable for the password for a particular plan. I have tried to reproduce the issue by running the plans multiple times from my side to check if there is an intermittent issue however I couldn't able to reproduce this behaviour in our lab environment.

As a next step, we would request you to do a small test and update us with the result, create a new plan under the same branch with the same configuration(environment variable) and let us know if it is getting successful or failing with a similar error.

This will help us to understand it's an issue with the configuration so that we need to look at the problematic plan and task to investigate further

If needed we can jump on a session to look into the issue and debug further.

I look forward to your response.

Still, that is not the correct !!

Yes, we have two Artifactory clusters but they are not connected to two separate DB clusters, but we have 1 load balancer connecting to two artifactory nodes, which are in turn connected to one Primary/HOT database cluster.

And this Database cluster employs docker container to have the HOT database cluster, and from this HOT DB cluster we are replicating/coyping the Postgres WAL files onto standby/warm DB clusters.


  1.  So, I was asking for any recommendations / best practices that it might be help for JFrog support as and when they are trying to debug any issues.


  1.  And also is there or are there any backup strategy in terms of DB.

Hi Rahul,

It sounds like you have two Artifactory clusters with separate databases where one is replicating to another. If this is the case, this should work. The secondary Artifactory can be used as a backup instance. The replication should copy your binaries, however, you will need to set up Access Federation to sync any users/permissions.

   I’m a little quite understand. We didn’t receive any system alert at that time. Of course, there was enough space at /var volume when artifactory crashed. Is it any parameter to control the size of cache?

  The second question is why JFrog didn’t clean the useless caches at regular interval? How does it work?

  For the last question, I’d like to consult what’s the difference between  cache and eventual.  _pre folder is in the both two directories.
And what are _pre and  _queue used for which in the eventual directory?

And what should we do to resolve this and the similar problems permanently?

Thank you for the information.

Seems like a disk space issue or more specifically disk space which might be related to the _pre under the cache fs.
The cache-fs does not include files that are in progress of being uploaded which are saved under cache/_pre. Thus it is recommended to keep extra spaces for _pre folder<https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fjira%2Fbrowse%2FRTFACT-14606&data=04%7C01%7Csjing%40paypal.com%7Cf4cbcff036ca4ed66e1008d997b181e9%7Cfb00791460204374977e21bac5f3f4c8%7C0%7C0%7C637707610915590158%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ubdgqtzrYYQENpzBQcz6Mqrd6wJYawf3Pwh6rLl%2B3%2FE%3D&reserved=0>.

02s6900002PAINwAAP5006900003YeiacAAB[#182280] Rust/Cargo issueHi Peter,
I appreciate you taking the time to respond.
As per the error code, please note that the HTTP status code 500 is a generic error response. It means that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This error is usually returned by the server when no other error code is suitable.
For the time being, because the problem is not reproducible and we don't have a pattern where the problem appears, we can't determine how to avoid it as per your question. I would recommend enabling the debugger logger as soon as the problem happens so that we can investigate the underlying cause of the behavior. You may send me the Support Bundle as soon as you add the loggers listed below, so I can start investigating this right away.
The below XML snippet goes in the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/logback.xml file and does not require a restart for log changes to take effect:

<logger name="org.artifactory.addon.git">
<level value="debug"/>
</logger>

Reproduce the issue on your end as soon as it reoccurs after adding the above snippet to the logback.xml file.
Finally, kindly share with me the following information:

Artifactory Support Bundle from the time of the issue
The timeframe of reproducing the issue to correlate the relevant logs

Please note that the loggers are resource-intensive. Therefore, once you have reproduced the issue and created the Support Bundle, please remove the logger snippets.
You may send the files directly to us via the JFrog Support Portal or email if the attachment size is less than 5 MB. Otherwise, you may use cURL to upload the content to our Artifactory SaaS account, as seen below:

curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/182280/"

No username and password are required.
I hope this clarifies.

Thanks a lot for the time in yesterday's session,

I've compared the java keystore lists of NAM and ULO and although we've added BSF java cert to NAM's "$JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/security/keys/trusted" directory, it wasn't available in the cacert keystore, while ULO had it.

I've imported it now manually and everything seems to be working fine i.e. I added BSF's repo into NAM's federation repo and worked out well, I also deployed a file to both repos and it got mirrored on the other sides.

I believe we can close this case. Thanks once again for the support, it is appreciated!

Subject: [#182468] Issue between federated repos


[External email -- Courriel externe]

Hi Dilyan,

Thank you for joining the call today, it was a pleasure meeting with you.

On the call, we have reviewed the setup of the federated repositories between the 3 instances. The BSF <> NAM federation is the problematic one, as when we attempt to add NAM repository to the BSF instance, we get the certificate not found error.
We have verified that all servers are synced in time. Then, we have tested the validity of the COT between the three instances and the results were valid:
BSF <> NAM - 204 response
BSF <> ULO - 204 response
NAM <> ULO - 204 response

We added the certificates from the nginx configuration file of BSF to the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/security/keys/trusted folder of the NAM instance and restarted Artifactory, however, still received the same error.
ULO and NAM have the same certs but when we attempted to add the NAM repository to BSF we got the error.

For further investigation, kindly run the following commands and share with us the 3 .crt files which will be created from the commands (server-nam.crt, server-ulo.crt, server-bsf.crt):



openssl s_client -connect srv-nam-art.prod.gw-4u.com:443 -showcerts < /dev/null > server-nam.crt



openssl s_client -connect srv-ulo-art.prod.gw-4u.com:443 -showcerts < /dev/null > server-ulo.crt



openssl s_client -connect srv-bsf-art.gw-4u.com:443 -showcerts < /dev/null > server-bsf.crt
In addition, please configure a smart remote repository<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Smart+Remote+Repositories#SmartRemoteRepositories-Configuration> from the BSF instance to point to a repository in the NAM instance (via https) and let us know whether you are able to successfully create this repository.

Looking forward to hearing from you, Dilyan.

Best regards,
Elina Floim

Also, the tomcat MaxThreads were configured to only 200 for Artifactory and 150 for Access service and the request rate at the time of the incident was quite high and because of this we strongly suspect the database was not able to handle the corresponding requests from Artifactory.

Further, in order to determine the cause of the problem, could you please help by sharing us with the max_connections value configured in the database? One of the main reasons for asking this information is because, from the Artifactory system.yaml, we could see the maxOpenconnections was not configured and this indicates that Artifactory currently uses the default database connections for Artifactory, Access, Metadata services.

Along with the above information, please share us with the current database specs used like RAM/CPU/Memory configurations.

I will look forward to hearing back from you.

02s6900002PAIPEAA55006900003YfCvAAAV[#182483] Unable to download artefacts from remote repositoryHi Ben,
Thank you for your time today. Over the session, you mentioned that test connection was throwing "Connection to remote repository failed: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target" error which we can ignore. This issue occurs just because the remote repository certificate is not added to the Java trust store of Artifactory. However, we were able to resolve a pom file using the following curl command after we enabled "Bypass HEAD Requests" option in Artifactory remote Advanced settings.

curl -uadmin:password  https://zedge2.jfrog.io/artifactory/ironsource-android-sdk/com/ironsource/sdk/mediationsdk/7.1.11/mediationsdk-7.1.11.pom

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

we have a problem with our license for JFrog Pro X, we received from you today.

We bought these licenses from your reseller (eficode.com) on the condition that it should start on February 1st, 2022 and ends on January 31, 2023.
In our delivery email it is stated, that our "JFrog Platform subscription will expire on: October 26, 2022".

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to the issue that you are facing, in order to debug the issue further, can you please share the below information with us -

1. What is the command that you are hitting to deploy the package to the Artifactory?

2. Is it happening all the time or is it intermittent?

3. From the logs I can see that the client version of Conan is 1.39.0. Can you please confirm if there was an upgrade to the client recently and after that, it has stopped working?

4. Are the other users facing the same issue or is it only to this user?

5. Can you please try to upload from a different client and check if you are still facing the issue?

6. From the logs I can see that you are trying to upload the packages to the "conan-local" repository. Can you please try to create a new test repository and point your client to that repository and try to upload the package to that repository and let us know if you are facing the same issue or not?

I will be waiting for your response.

Hi Yoga,

Thank you for joining the session with us.
Over the session, we further discussed the issue encountered with upgrades and tried to extract the individual license and passed over the values.yaml in order to update the licenses.
However, we still could see old licenses files in the artifactory.cluster.license file and we decided to delete the file in primary and member nodes

With regards to your query on using the mc service within Artifactory, as you are using Mission control as a separate installation, you will need to perform the export/import of the data from the old instance and import the configurations within Artifactory by following the steps as mentioned on our confluence page<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Migrating*Platform*Deployments*and*License*Buckets*MigratingPlatformDeploymentsandLicenseBuckets-MigratingtheMissionControldatabasetoArtifactory__;KysrKysj!!KT8c38mO!i-zamnF6CQF3ro5RRp7Ry7IGex4MPnN7AgS61EIV7boQ96ToEeWjpht49_BfABZd$>.

I have also attached the values.yaml file reference<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/github.com/jfrog/charts/blob/master/stable/artifactory-ha/values.yaml*L1686__;Iw!!KT8c38mO!i-zamnF6CQF3ro5RRp7Ry7IGex4MPnN7AgS61EIV7boQ96ToEeWjpht495JiUqdh$> for enabling Mission control within Artifactory and we would recommend you to try this in order to migrate the Mission control.

In case of any further assistance regarding the Mission Control migration, we would recommend you to open a new ticket which will help us to keep track of the issues as we are tracking the issues related to the Artifactory upgrade.

As the upgrade related issues are resolved, I will go ahead and mark this case as closed.
Please contact us for any further assistance in the future, we will be glad to assist.

2. ‘At roughly 3am UTC today the task was recycled.’  Could you please elaborate on the activity which was performed as part of this task? We are requesting this information to understand the nature of the issue.

3. Please provide the ‘security.import.xml’ file from the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory directory for our validation.

Kindly need answer for these Questions


  1.  Xray need Postgres db right , can we point dedicated external db (existing) for xray as done to artficatory or else we need to up db in dedicated node or in same node where we install xray?
  2.  Regardless of where db installation done , to connect xray to db we need to create xraydb user in postgres and grant all the privileges to that user then perform the connection right?

Thanks,

The JSON payload looks good, however, we need to use Xray API with this payload.  Below is the example format of the cURL command for your reference:

curl -XPOST -uadmin:password -H "Content-Type:application/json" <JPD-URL>/xray/api/v1/component/exportDetails -d '{ "violations": false, "include_ignored_violations": true, "license": true, "security": true, "exclude_unknown": false, "component_name": "fk-flights-proxy:02a378e9c47380e9cdd891db00c79c7bfa9c42a6", "package_type": "docker", "output_format": "csv" }' -OJ

And looks like I linked the incorrect URL for the Vulnerabilities Report document earlier, hence, passing the wiki links again as below:
Export Component Details
Generate Vulnerabilities Report
Generate Violations Report

I hope this helps. Please let me know if you face any other issues.

02s6900002PAIcmAAH5006900003jaXF9AAM[#183880] One of three nodes  in one JFrog cluster crashedHi Shuo,

Perhaps there is a difference between the monitoring tool time and the logs time, I saw also a difference in time between different logs as well.
I just looked at my previous message, And I gave the wrong link by mistake, so basically, this link is the correct one.
It explains how you control the maxCacheSize (by default it's 10 GB) through the binarystore.xml

When controlling it you also make sure to allocate enough space for the _pre.
For your second question - Artifactory doesn't clean the files under the _pre, he basically moves them to the cache/eventual (depends on the provider) once they are finished to be validated.

I am not sure what happened during this time, maybe there was a burst of requests, a high peak which caused a high load on the server which might cause some slowness, but I do not have this kind of information to determine it.
Usually, we can check monitoring tools about what happened during this time in terms of the number of requests, CPU usage, load average, network bandwidth, etc, and in parallel get matrices from JMX monitoring.
If you see unsual activity during 22 October, please share it with me.

As for the _pre, you can find an additional explanation here.
The queues are quite simple, it contains a list of artifacts that will be eventually be uploaded or deleted from the S3.

Right now you have 100 GB of cache-fs, do you see it constantly full? If yes, we should consider increasing it - On a high scale, if the cache-fs is too low in size, it will be busier with rotating than actually serving from the cache, so a bigger cache can help improve the performance of download requests and thus also reduce the requests done against the S3.

Also, since you are an E+ customer there are more tuning that you can do to reduce the load from the server, but it will require some additional modifications to the binarystore.xml and further testings.
The one I particularly recommend (and it's not a complicated change) is the direct cloud storage download.
Basically with this method, Artifactory upon download request will redirect the client to download the file directly from the S3 and you can configure this for specific repositories and for a specific size of files (e.g file size which is larger than 20 MB).

The main advantage of such a method is that it reduces the load from the Artifactory since it's moving the load to the client.
Also, usually, Amazon machines have a network bandwidth limit, but there is no limit when downloading from the S3 directly, so you are not limited by it with this method.

There is also a feature called direct upload where we remove the eventual and uploads will be uploaded directly to the S3 which is called direct upload (eventual-less), however, this will require you to change the binarystore.xml entirely and will require additional tests before implementing it but for now, it should be easier to implement the first method while both can help.

02s6900002PAIdLAAX5006900003jadAXAAY[#183994] Fwd: Following our commercial discussionHi Roni,

Thank you for the response.

Regarding your question, in general, it depends on your decision and according to your working processes.
Artifactory suggests by default the following conversion template:

environment type(dev/prod)-packageType-local/remote/virtual

<prefix>-<package-type>-<repotype>

e.g
dev-nuget-local


Additionally, with respect to your on-prem step up and to the above question, it is important to note that according to our company policy, each issue/topic should be handled in a separate ticket. Therefore, if you have additional questions, kindly open a new ticket and we will assist accordingly.

Thank you for your understanding.

Kindly re-open the ticket as the changing GC parameter didn't help in cleaning up the TrashCan, also earlier queries were unanswered.

I have provided the filtered GC logs, you can find only 300000(approx.) files were processed from TrashCan each day, however we have 10 million files in TrashCan. Hence at this rate we cannot reduce the TrashCan files, Kindly let us know further steps.

Since this is very critical to us , we would like to expedite and if possible route it to next level engineers who is expert in Garbage collection. Thanks

02s6900002PAIexAAH5006900003YfYLbAAN[#182902] Configuration of Repositorys in Artifactory 7Hi Tim-Stephan,

After further investigation, this error means that Artifactory is trying to index the .apk package and is unable to do so. It doesn’t mean that there are any issues with the artifact itself. If you would like to suppress the error, you can set the index value for this mimetype to false. This can be done by editing the following line in the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/mimetypes.xml file:

<mimetype type="application/vnd.android.package-archive" extensions="apk" archive="true" index="false" css="apk"/>

I hope this clarifies.

Best regards,

02s6900002PAIeAAAX5006900003Mol2MAAR[#179197] BackupHi Raveendra

The repository size that you are mentioning in the UI is the Artifact Size i.e. 112.98 KB which is also the size of the artifact that I have uploaded to the repository. However, the backup folder shows the complete repository size i.e. artifact as well as the metadata file size which is why the size is more than the actual file. If I go inside this repository folder and validate the size of the artifact itself the size is as expected. Please find the screenshot below which shows the size of the repository as well as the size of the artifact:


Do let me know if there are any further queries or concerns. We will be glad to assist.

02s6900002PAIXdAAP5006900003MqZVyAAN[#180560] Issues with creating Support BundleHi Gourav,

Thank you for your time on session, below is the session summary:

We have created a support bundle and tried to download which basically failed and threw an error message.
Then we try to access the artifactory using the server IP address and downloading of the support bundle goes successful.
Then we review Apache reverse proxy configuration which is actually used in the production environment.
Compared it with Apache reverse proxy downloaded from Artifactory.
We found Allow Encoded Slash was set to NoDecode for http & https, so we have changed the configuration and set Allow Encoded Slash to On and restarted the Apache service.
After logging into Artifactory, we were able to download the support bundle for Artifactory & Xray.

As per our discussion, I am going ahead with closure of the case.

Have a nice day!!

Aashish Singh

Indu is on extended parental leave at the moment and I'll be continuing on with the investigation from our side
I can't be certain whether 'csc-orcs-docker-dev-local' was the repository Indu used to test, but can confirm that this is one of the outstanding repos which is failing to reach 100% - so it's definitely possible that this was the repo Indu used to test. If so, is there a reason why Xray is unable to find this artifact?
Can you confirm if these artifacts are added in the metadata on the Artifactory side and share the screenshots with us?Looking forward to your response.
Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by the metadata on Artifactory and which artifacts you're referring to?
Please let me know if there's anything else I can provideRegards,Liam

If I run following command, only see xml populated but not jar/artifacts.

wget –spider -o ~/wget.log -w 1 -r -np https://artifactory.qa.ebay.com/artifactory/r-ebaycentral-internaltoolsReleases/

Attached the screenshot for log and view.

Please let us know what is blocking here. Is that -r option only support depth 5?

       -r
       --recursive
           Turn on recursive retrieving.    The default maximum depth is 5.

Hi Yi,

There shouldn't be any harm, any copy operation will check the file list between the two repositories and only copy the differences, so it won't take additional resources as the cache repo gets larger.

02s6900002PAIklAAH5006900003YecF3AAJ[#182100] Slow UI speedHi Akshi,

Thank you for replying back with the test results.

I noticed from the screenshot you shared that the LDAPS url is configured with port 3268. Did you also try configuring the LDAPS url with port 3269 (LDAPS Global Catalog port)?

ldaps://qed-ldap.qualcomm.com:3269


Adding the debug loggers can be helpful in further troubleshooting the LDAP connection. However, the loggers mentioned in the page you referred to are for Artifactory version 6.x.
For version 7.x, this appender and logger should be added to the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/logback.xml file:

<appender name="ldap" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
  <File>${log.dir}/artifactory-ldap.log</File>
  <rollingPolicy class="org.jfrog.common.logging.logback.rolling.FixedWindowWithDateRollingPolicy">
    <FileNamePattern>${log.dir.archived}/artifactory-ldap.%i.log.gz</FileNamePattern>
    <maxIndex>10</maxIndex>
  </rollingPolicy>
  <triggeringPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy">
    <MaxFileSize>25MB</MaxFileSize>
  </triggeringPolicy>
  <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.core.encoder.LayoutWrappingEncoder">
    <layout class="org.jfrog.common.logging.logback.layout.BackTracePatternLayout">
      <pattern>%date{yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS, UTC}Z [jfrt ] [%-5p] [%-16X{uber-trace-id}] [%-30.30(%c{3}:%L)] [%-20.20thread] - %m%n</pattern>
    </layout>
  </encoder>
</appender>
<logger name="org.springframework.security.ldap" additivity="false">
  <level value="trace"/>
  <appender-ref ref="ldap"/>
</logger>
<logger name="org.artifactory.addon.ldap" additivity="false">
  <level value="trace"/>
  <appender-ref ref="ldap"/>
</logger>
<logger name="org.artifactory.security.ldap" additivity="false">
  <level value="trace"/>
  <appender-ref ref="ldap"/>
</logger>
<logger name="org.artifactory.webapp.servlet.AccessFilter" additivity="false">
  <level value="trace"/>
  <appender-ref ref="ldap"/>
</logger>


Once the file is saved, Artifactory will automatically start logging the LDAP related entries in a new log file named artifactory-ldap.log so no restart is required.

Please make sure to remove this appender and logger once the issue is resolved as this log file tends to fill up quickly and consume extra disk space.

I look forward to your update.

I have a response to the information we found during online session from the customer:We noticed this information as well. We indeed use the third part package common-logging-1.2.jar. https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/commons-logging/commons-logging https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/commons-logging/commons-logging/1.2/ https://github.com/search?p=2&q=bytedance+commons-logging&type=Code We checked again for the common-logging-1.2 jar package and source code. However, there is no any information or component about the com.bytedance.ttgame:Lenovo_common_logging and have no idea why it will show the license of "com.bytedance.ttgame:Lenovo_common_logging" We are thinking that perhaps " com.bytedance.ttgame:Lenovo_common_logging" depends on commons-logging-1.2. Hopefully Jfrog could help to figure out this. https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.bytedance.ttgame/lenovo_common_logging
As you can see the package itself is using another license and there is still a question why the license is identified incorrectly for it.
BR, Denys

02s6900002PAIsVAAX5006900003jajzDAAQRe: [#184143] SSL certificate issue while upload/download of any remote packageHi team,
We have created conan local repository where we uploaded few Artifacts using browser (Artifactory UI).We are able to download/upload Artifacts from browser. But, when we open command line and invoke following commands.
conan download conan_demo/1.2.1@eden/test --remote Artifactory_conanconan upload conan_demo/1.2.1@eden/test --force --remote Artifactory_conan --all
We receive error as mentioned below:
 ERROR: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='artifactory-test.icp.infineon.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /artifactory/api/conan/conan-itdsard-e2e-testautomation-local/v1/ping (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1056)')))

To correct the above error is it required to provide any SSL configuration from backend and frontend? or rather Artifactory should use the system default global settings?

02s6900002PAItOAAX5006900003jak3oAAARe: [#184144] Federation limitationsHi,
We have two questions around federated repos.
We were wondering the logic behind limiting the number of instances in a federated repo to 10. Is there a solution to exceed that limit and what would the consequence be?
Is there a limit to the number of federated repositories per instance. Is something like 25 000 too much? Should we expected any performance degradation?

Thanks,
Cyriaque

02s6900002PAIwdAAH5006900003jak4wAAARe: [#184145] X-Ray doesn't scan NuGet packages for Vulnerabilities nor LicesnesHi,
We have troubles with X-Ray and NuGet package scanning.
During the analysis of X-Ray's output we've noticed that there aren't any issues with regard to NuGet packages (majority being Jar's and NPM's).
After this discovery we've created a vulnerable package and pushed it into the Artifactory so that X-ray can find it and scan it. To our surprise the package wan't flagged as vulnerable:
Picture 1. No vulnerabilities found by X-Ray in any version of the vulnerable NuGet package
Picture 2. Details about newset version (1.0.3) of the vulnerable package show not Violations, Security nor License.
Picture 3. Different view, same package.
We were under the impression that X-Ray can scan and detect vulnerabilities and license violations for NuGet packages as it is claimed on the landing page and within the documentation:

Is there anything we're missing here?
Regards,Andrzej Dyjak

However in artifactory the local repositories are resolved first no matter if a remote repository is listed before a local repository.Can this behaviour be changed, so that the artifacts are getting resolved in the exact same order the repositories are listed?

Server on-prem (if reside on intel) can’t be reached out from public internet. It is impossible. For that we need to place the server in DMZs which are not present in the locations where we need EDGE functionality.

Given the fact we are utilizing public cloud, we can think of a setup where edge can be contacted inbound from allowed Ips of JPD/s we are hosting at the same cloud provider.

I am missing some details from your arch to start thinking of it. Pls call me to 0547887077 for few tech questions about the edge. To understand if self-hosted  edge with SaaS Jfrog is feasible at all in our case.

Thanks, Natan

Subject: [#183994] Fwd: Following our commercial discussion
Hi Natan,

Thank you for your patient.

Please allow me to share with you that we have enabled a circle of trust to the following instances in order to be able to set federated repositories:



Mothership instance: laasazwestusb

Mothership Cloud Provider: Microsoft Azure

https://laasazwestusb.jfrog.io

Server Version: 7.27.6

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mothership instance: laaseucentralb

Mothership Cloud Provider: Amazon

https://laaseucentralb.jfrog.io

Server Version: 7.27.6

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mothership instance: laasazjspsing

Mothership Cloud Provider: Microsoft Azure

https://laasazjspsing.jfrog.io

Server Version 7.27.6
Please configure federated repositories and let us know whether you are able to do it successfully.

As for step 2, in order for us to set a circle of trust between the on-prem edge nodes to the SaaS instance, the edge node should be public and accessible, meaning the SaaS instance should have the ability to reach the edge nodes and vise versa. Please share with us whether this is will be possible on your side, and if it does, you should share the following with us:
The on-prem edge nodes public certificates. Then, we will update the instance root certificates on the cloud server.
The service's root certificate can be pulled in the following ways:

  1.  Under "$JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/access/keys/root.crt" (requires physical access to the server).
  2.  Alternatively, by calling Get Root Certificate REST API<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-GetRootCertificate>.
To pass the information to us using a secured method, you may follow this KB<https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/transferring-my-sensitive-content-to-jfrog-using-public-key-encryption/>.

Looking forward to your reply.

02s6900002PAJ8OAAX5006900003jad3RAAQRe: [#183993] Xray config and debugHi David,
Thank you for the responseWe have Xray running now, the only blocker seemed to be port 8082 was not open through iptables.
While we were troubleshooting on the phone with Muhammed he pointed this out, however we did not see a single jfrog process consuming any ports at that point, even with the PS command showing no processes running. It seems allowing 8082 through iptables was required for all other internal processes to start up.
We use puppet to automate some of this process, and we have rules in place to open 8082. It was simply not executed yet.Now that 8082 is open, we can reach 8046 on the localhost.Most of the errors are now gone from console.log on the xray node

Hi Shlomi,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to the reported behavior, I have parsed over the logs where I see the requests to remote repository registry.connect.redhat.com are not authorized.

2021-10-25T08:53:48.833Z [jfrt ] [WARN ] [5d5f74839739b974] [o.a.r.RemoteRepoBase:512      ] [tp-nio-8081-exec-119] - redhatconnect-remote: Error in getting information for 'mongodb/enterprise-operator/latest/list.manifest.json' (java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't fetch token for repo: redhatconnect-remote realm: https://registry.connect.redhat.com/auth/realms/rhcc/protocol/redhat-docker-v2/auth scope:repository:mongodb/enterprise-operator:pull).

Can you please confirm if the tokens or passwords used for registry.connect.redhat.com<https://registry.connect.redhat.com/> in the “redhatconnect-remote” are correct and if it's an authentication token, please confirm if they are not changed/regenerated? Please try to test access by performing the docker/podman login directly to the registry as below:

docker login -u='<user>' -p='<password/token>' registry.connect.redhat.com

Please check the above and let us know your observations.

Looking forward to your update.

02s6900002PAJC6AAP5006900003AQBgwAAH[#168100] Artifactory service not startingHello Michael,

Thank you for your response. Currently, the only available option is to install Artifacoty in a location (a directory that gives run and execute permissions to all users).
Alternatively, you can write some custom scripts to check the service and start Artifactory and during startup, you can enable a cron expression to start Artifactory after every reboot.

After Reboot

@reboot /ebs/artifactory-pro-7.27.6/app/bin/artifactory.sh start

To manually start the Artifactory instance use the below command.

/ebs/artifactory-pro-7.27.6/app/bin/artifactory.sh start

I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any further questions/concerns in this matter, we will be happy to assist you.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for reaching out.
Artifactory is coming bundled with tomcat with a specific version, upgrading it manually is not supported,  this is only the configuration that we support.
Can you please elaborate on which security vulnerabilities we discuss?
I ask since we do provide support with mitigating those and SLA for vulnerabilities that depend on the severity of such.

I will appreciate it if you can share the relevant CVE's and the security tools used to find those.

Hi Shlomi,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to the reported behavior, I have parsed over the logs where I see the requests to remote repository registry.connect.redhat.com are not authorized.

Can you please confirm if the tokens or passwords used for registry.connect.redhat.com<https://registry.connect.redhat.com/> in the “redhatconnect-remote” are correct and if it's an authentication token, please confirm if they are not changed/regenerated? Please try to test access by performing the docker/podman login directly to the registry as below:

docker login -u='<user>' -p='<password/token>' registry.connect.redhat.com

Please check the above and let us know your observations.

Looking forward to your update.

02s6900002PAJGIAA55006900003jaaczAAA[#183962] Jfrog Artifactory 7.27.3 not opening & stuck at JFrog pageHi Gaurav,

The filestore only hosts the binaries uploaded to Artifactory. This number is called “Binaries Size” and can be viewed in the storage page in Artifactory UI.

Everything else resides in the database, for example:
1. Repositories
2. Users
3. Information about artifacts
4. Configuration files

While the size of the filestore is the same as your “Binaries Size”, the database size varies depending on many different factors, such as the number of artifact properties, users, etc.

An Artifactory system export will always contain a copy of the entire database. Additionally, you can choose whether or not to include the binaries (filestore) using the “Exclude Content” checkbox.

For example, users with a Cloud based storage (S3) can perform a system export without binaries (Exclude Content checked) and later on connect their new instance to the existing S3 bucket, which saves a lot of time.

Please let me know if this helps.

Joey Naor

Subject: [#183994] Fwd: Following our commercial discussion

Hi Roni,

Thank you for the response.

Regarding your question, in general, it depends on your decision and according to your working processes.
Artifactory suggests by default the following conversion template:



environment type(dev/prod)-packageType-local/remote/virtual



<prefix>-<package-type>-<repotype>



e.g

dev-nuget-local

Additionally, with respect to your on-prem step up and to the above question, it is important to note that according to our company policy, each issue/topic should be handled in a separate ticket. Therefore, if you have additional questions, kindly open a new ticket and we will assist accordingly.

Thank you for your understanding.

Yes, I am able to reach the UI, see the attached files UI_1.jpg to UI_3.jpg for service status before I restarted the nodes.I then restarted the nodes as you said, and now the "Access" row is also "Healthy" and with version "2.27.5" for all nodes. I am also able to create support bundles (See attached file "LargeBundle")!
Although I did get one error from the first twp nodes on the startup of the last node:"2021-10-26T07:29:16.708Z [jfac ] [ERROR] [6456e9935e3c49ba] [o.j.c.ExecutionUtils:178   ] [pool-18-thread-3  ] - Last retry failed: 'jfconnect.entitlements.register' config key wasn't change. Not trying again (code exception)" What does that mean? Might this cause issues in the future?
Regarding your questions:We are using the volume mount point "/opt/app/jfrog..." instead of "/opt/jfrog...". It is the local filesystem.I did not get the propagation error again. I suspect that the bundle that I created has enough data. But if it is not, let me know and I will provide the additional data requested. In that case, I would need to stop the servers again to zip the var folder, wouldn't I?Thank you!

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to your query about restricting anonymous user  access to the local repository ,please note that currently, it is supported in 5.2.1 version of Artifactory.
Anonymous user refers to anyone who logged into Artifactory/executed REST API calls without credentials.
You can, however control the permission level to the repositories for the anonymous user as you will see in the example below:

First, you go to user management console under Admin-> Security->User as shown below :-




Select anonymous user under permissions tab and open it:-






Under any remote tab , please deselect Manage,Delete,Deploy ,Annotate and Read tab as shown below:-





Under anything tab , please deselect remote and distribution repositories and select only local repositories ( In this case libs-release-local , libs-snapshot-local):-

02s6900002PAJMLAA55006900003jagIbAAI[#184041] Artifactory 7.x installation through Azure ARM templateHi Senthilnathan,

Thank you for reaching out.
Not sure I understood this sentence:
"using earlier experience in creating script for 6.x I've reached up to successful installation of Artifactory 7.x" can you clarify this?

As for the error, it seems that we couldn't parse the system.yaml and by looking at the system.yaml you have provided.
I used this website to parse it and couldn't, seems that there an encoding issues probably because of editing it on windows text editor and then copying it to linux.

I was able to find two issues:
1. In the line where there is         user: artifactory, after I removed all of the spaces before the word 'user' and then recreating them (for correcting the indentations) in linux it solved the issue with this line.
2. I then had the same issue also on the line bootstrapKeysReadTimeoutSecs: 120 so I did the same as 1. and then I was able to parse the yaml.

02s6900002PAJMVAA55006900003YgECUAA3[#183317] Issues with SAMLHello Alvaro,

Thank you for confirming the use case.

I believe the user-group association is working with the UI. However, you are facing the issue whenever you are trying to resolve the packages from Jenkins.

This is a known issue as described in this JIRA (RTFACT-14466) that the user group association for the SAML users are not persistent and it will be persistent only specific to UI session. As soon as you log out of the UI session, the association will be lost. That is the reason why it is not working when you are trying to resolve the package from the Jenkins it is not working as it is losing the user and group association.

In order to get rid of this issue, we have introduced the feature called SCIM which is described in this link - https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/SCIM#SCIM-AzureADAzureAD. However, please be informed that for this, it is required to have the "Security Pack" subscription. I have included your account manager in case you do not have that subscription and would like to have it.

Please let me know if you have any queries. I will be glad to assist you.

02s6900002PAJP0AAP5006900003jahrMAAQ[#184063] How to debug certificate issues?Hi Gido,
Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
With regards to the “Checking remote artifactory version has failed: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target.” issue, this might arise if you are using a self-signed certificate or a certificate that’s been issued by an internal certificate authority, or if your clients (e.g., browser, Java) are outdated.
You may refer to this KB article that discusses this issue and possible solutions.
I hope this helps.

Best regards,

02s6900002PAJT2AAP5006900003jaiPFAAY[#184080] Helm RepoHi Todd,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

Since the index.yaml file and the actual charts are located in different hosts/path the configuration of the Helm remote repository needs to be as follows:

The repository URL should point to the root path where the index.yaml is found - "https://helm.datadoghq.com"
The  "Chart Base URL" should point to the path where the charts are stored - "https://github.com/DataDog/helm-charts/releases/download/"

I tested on my end and verified that I was able to proxy the Datadog Helm repo and the charts are cached in Artifactory.
Please find below screenshot of the remote repository configuration I used:




Make sure to aggregate the remote repository in a virtual repo (in order to properly resolve charts, virtual repository is required) and to update the client (helm repo update) before trying to resolve the charts.

Let me know if the above configuration works on your end, I look forward to your update.

02s6900002PAJTlAAP5006900003jacVMAAY[#183984] Urgent - remote docker repo not workingHi Roman,
Thank you for the reply.
If I understand correctly, the dbank-public-docker-virtual is a virtual repository that contains several remote repositories, that one of which is the public-docker-microsoft-mcr-remote.
The public-docker-remote on the DMZ points to the public-docker-virtual that contains several repositories, such as the dbank-public-docker-virtual.
Please share with me the repositories under the dbank-public-docker-virtual and public-docker-virtual on the SaaS instance along with the Artifactory version of the DMZ instance as I want to work on creating a similar testing environment.
Below is the setting of the repositories from my test.
SaaS, docker-virtual contain a test-docker-local (local empty repository) and a remote docker-microsoft:
docker-microsoft on SaaS was created with the default settings:
On-prem, remote repository docker-remote-saas that points to the docker-virtual repository on SaaS, was also created with the default configurations:
In addition to the above, please test the following, configure the public-docker-remote on the DMZ directly to the public-docker-microsoft-mcr-remote repository and let me know if you were able to pull Docker images.
As for the Support Bundle, I would like to take a look at the artifactory.config.latest.xml file, artifactory-service.log, artifactory-request.log, and artifactory-access.log with the previously shared added logger from the time when the docker pull was executed, along with the docker login and pull commands and client output.
Looking forward to your update.

Thank you for raising this ticket. Here is a general process to change the Access service ID for Artifactory 7.x.

1. Obtain the current Access service ID using (use an admin token, can be generated from the UI):
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" -vv -XGET http://localhost:8040/access/api/v1/system/service_id

2. Run this Delete command against the DB:
$ DELETE FROM access_configs WHERE config_name='serviceId';

3. Create the following "marker file" on one of the nodes:
$ touch /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/bootstrap/etc/access/keys/reset_root_keys

4. Restart the node where the marker file was created.
5. Restart the other nodes in the cluster.

Please confirm the above works and let us know if you have any further questions.

Hi Stephen and Maria,

The licenses are not imported by the steps that we did, this is for assigned custom licenses. However, we did an internal check, it seems that once we add the license into the environment, all assigned custom licenses will be populated. Hope this helps.

I am still unable to reproduce the issue.
However, reviewing the video I do see the following.
Gen4cc-dev local on source is an RPM repository, while the jdx-dev on target is Generic Type. Please note I was still able to download/cache items successfully.
I have also noticed that you have no “artifactory” section in your URL string to the source.
Do you have the option to add artifactory to the URL string and see if this is working?
For example:
Instead of: https://repl.artifactory.deere.com/gen4cc-dev → use → https://repl.artifactory.deere.com/artifactory/gen4cc-dev
Please also send me the Reverse proxy configuration for the source Artifactory, I will try to reproduce it using smiler configurations.

thanks for taking care in this case.
> this might arise if you are using a self-signed certificate or a certificate that’s been issued by an internal certificate authority, or if your clients (e.g., browser, Java) are outdated.
I have four identically configured systems, two are working, two shows the error. I need to find out why. On all four systems, there are the same certificates, Java versions, cacerts etc. All four systems are RHEL systems so they have the same certificates and stores. I need to debug the issue and find out which certificate cause the error and from where the issues comes.
So the question remain how to debug such error? How to narrow down the cause? Can you provide some debug settings for logback.xmland to get better information on the issue? Therefore I am looking for something like 
<appender name="tls" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">...
or PKI, or Java cacerts or whatever my be fit in such case.

02s6900002PAJbkAAH5006900003jai4kAAA[#184068] Docker Login - Auth Header goes missingHi Chris,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

In general, the flow of a docker login is as follows:

1) First the client will send a '/v2' request without any credentials which should indeed result with the 401.
With the 401 error, the registry (Artifactory) should also send a response header 'WWW-authenticate' with a Bearer realm that the client will use for authentication.

2) The next request should be 'api/docker/null/v2/token' if you are using the repository path or 'api/docker/<REPO_NAME>/v2/token' if you are using the subdomain/port method for docker. The client should send parameters in the URL. For example when I login with a user 'user1', the following is sent:

api/docker/docker/v2/token?account=user1&client_id=docker&offline_token=true&service=docker.platform.oronc.com:443

The 'account' is the username that is used in the docker login command and the 'service' is the host returned in the 'WWW-authenticate' header of the previous request.
A header 'Authorization Basic ..' should also be sent by the client for this request.

3) The client should now issue a request for '/v2' with a granted token 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'.

The non_authneticated_user 401 response from Artifactory is expected and is used to determine the Bearer realm, it should not affect the auth header not sent by the client.
As per my understanding you already found that in stage (2) the request is sent without auth. I advise to check the first '/v2' request and catch the outgoing headers and response as well.
Based on your input, it is possible that the auth is stripped by the proxy/ALB.

Let me know if I can further assist.

02s6900002PAJcxAAH5006900003jaZbrAAE[#183930] Support zone bundles intermittently failHi Kyle,

The Support Bundle task will collect logs/configuration from all the nodes in the cluster.
We expect to see relevant logs in each of the nodes.

I understand the collecting logs from all 8 nodes might not be simple, therefore I suggest one of the following:

1. You mentioned the issue is intermittent. If a creation of the Support Bundle fails and later succeeds the successful bundle should contain logs from the failed attempt (as long as too much time has not passed and the logs were not rotated).

2. If getting logs from all 8 nodes is not possible, please share with me logs from the primary node and one of the member nodes.
I will check these first, to see if possible cause for the failure could be seen within these logs alone.

Once you are able to collect logs from a failed attempt, please share with me the bundle name that failed to create and an estimated timeframe when it was attempted, so I can narrow down the search in the logs.

I look forward to your update.

Thanks for your reply, but please be aware that it's been weeks that we can't send you support bundle because of the permission issue on https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/

[cid:image003.jpg@01D7CA54.3D601690]

Because of this issue, we are blocked in troubleshooting several cases :

-           Case # 179910<https://support.jfrog.com/s/tickets/5006900003MpkqH> : "500 Error : java.lang.OutOfMemoryError" when using "Set Me Up" button in production environment

-           Case #176800 : Xray database sync issue in preproduction environment

-           [Case not created yet] : Artifactory UI slowness in production environment

-

-           ...

My managers are starting to get impatient, we'd like to have more visibility on the date of resolution.

Thanks,
Best regards

Hello Thibault,

Thank you for writing back to us.

As our production Xray DB sync is working as expected, It is advisable not to run the DB queries on the production environment. Please share the latest support bundle from the non production environment to troubleshoot further.

As the DB sync is working as expected on the Production environment, could you please provide your approval to split the case and continue troubleshooting the non production on a new case for better tracking purpose. We always recommend having different cases for different environments which will help us in backtracking as and when necessary.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

02s6900002PAJeAAAX5006900003YfYT1AANRe: [#182906] PyPi: Package download over Edge Node fails with 404Hi Ohad,
we tried downloading the package from a Linux Environment (Debian) and still got the same error message. We can reproduce the error with the following packages:
* ansible* ansible-core* torch
Maybe it has something to do with the package size? The package "scikit-qfit" is relatively small and can be installed without any problems. 
If I reference the remote repository ("py-pypi-proxy") directly, the download works. There are only a few timeouts until the artifactory has loaded the package from the WWW and is cached locally.  Once it is in Artifactory's cache, it can be downloaded via the Edge instance:
t27087a@vbkpp008ida0005:~$ pip install --no-cache-dir torch

Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable

Last Friday we tried to do the upgrade to 7.27 on host artifactory-1001, which remains broken until now.We are trying to do a restart on host artifactory-2001 and failing.
From the ansible result, it seems like all hosts, except for artifactory-1001, are running on 3.1.11 xmlns.We also have 2 recently provisioned(few weeks ago) hosts (not shown in log above) that are running but the artifactory.config.* files does not exist.It seems like artifactory-2004 is running on 3.0.8 for some unclear reason.
The diff between the outdated file in artifactory-2004 vs the file in a running box artifactory-1002 seems mostly related to new repository creations/configuration updates.What actions are you recommending here?

Related to original issue:Our DBA team want to ask if it's ok to create the table with a primary key like this
CREATE TABLE access_db_check
(
 username VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
 sorting_order INT NOT NULL,
 PRIMARY KEY (username, sorting_order) 
)
Would this help unblock the migration?Could you please elaborate a bit on the use case of this table?
Thanks

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
There is no option which will convert internal urls within a file on the remote to local Artifactory urls.
Generic remote repository has no metadata calculations, it basically mirrors the Jenkins or other external repository.
If a file there references other external links those links will be used.
Hope this clarifies.
Let us know if you have any additional questions, we'll be happy to help.

  1.  copy the zip file into var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/backup/filename.zip
  2.  unzip the archive into a new folder like „restore“
  3.  go to Artifacotr UI and select just the folder here?

Betreff: [#183751] Artifactory restore


Hello Philipp,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

I was able to reproduce the issue that you encountered when using a zip file. It seems that there is a bug in Artifactory preventing it from recognizing that it is attempting to import a zip file. The bug has been reported here https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-26035

In order to work around this, you are going to need to expand the zip directory into a folder and then import that folder.

I hope this helps, I look forward to your feedback.

02s6900002PAJigAAH5006900003jaeeAAAQ[#184014] User API Keys Changed after Java Version ChangeHi Karthikeyan,

Thank you for the clarification.

I have discussed this use case with our R&D team and we concluded that getting back the old (unchanged) API keys might only be possible with a full Artifactory + DB restore.

With that being said, due to the outdated Artifactory version you’re using, the restoration process could be problematic and cause loss of data. Therefore, we recommend adapting your environment to the new API keys, followed by tuning the Artifactory VM to prevent the accidental JDK upgrade in the future.

Please let me know what you think.

Best regards,
Joey Naor

An additional question regarding this Artifacotry Cluster instance. (But unrelated, hopefully, to the errors).When I look under "Administration -> Monitoring -> Storage" (see attached image "storage.jpg") it says "sharding-cluster, even though I have specified "cluster-file-system" in the binaraystore.xml configuration file. 
Is this the correct display for cluster-file-system (since it contains "sharding-cluster" under the hood)? Or has the filestore configuration failed?

Subject: [#180835] Nuget timeouts and Artifactory not serving from cache


Hi Stephen,

I have checked and discussed the issue internally, as per functionality of Nuget Repository, Artifactory looks for available versions of packages that have been requested. So it goes to upstream i.e. nuget.org<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnuget.org%2F&data=04%7C01%7CStephen.OBrien%40chrobinson.com%7Ce6a74b60e6bc498a52ed08d9945bce54%7Cd441ad83623546d6ab1a89744a91b1d8%7C1%7C0%7C637703944300857248%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=KaJqpxxRRhjnz2uF5snJ9A6u6P7f1XBEJBIVkkr3VcM%3D&reserved=0> to resolve the package, so even if you have a package that is available on Remote Repository cache when a request has been made it goes to upstream before resolving the package from Remote Repository Cache.

I have done a lot of research on the scenario and found we have a JIRA opened RTMID-20557 (This is an Internal JIRA, so it won't be accessible from outside).

R&D is working on bringing the changes so Nuget Repository will resolve the packages from Nuget Repository cache also if nuget.org<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnuget.org%2F&data=04%7C01%7CStephen.OBrien%40chrobinson.com%7Ce6a74b60e6bc498a52ed08d9945bce54%7Cd441ad83623546d6ab1a89744a91b1d8%7C1%7C0%7C637703944300867208%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=G8i%2BeoLkWOLU7kGQKoNWe24YZWmhAhfiPfbf9va7eiA%3D&reserved=0> is not accessible.

02s6900002PAJo5AAH5006900003jagI7AAI[#184040] Xray scan on python imagesHi Mathew,

Thank you for reaching out.

Even though the Redhat Catalog has images with a health index of A, Xray still scans the components for vulnerabilities and reports the findings based on the global vulnerability database. I’m not sure what Redhat uses to define which vulnerabilities are serious or not.

Looking over the report, it looks like the python component itself has a few low/medium vulnerabilities while it’s dependencies have some High vulnerabilities. If you would like to dig deeper into the sources of these vulnerabilities, please create a Report for this Watch (Reports → Create New Report):

Next, please export the information in CSV and share the results with me:

The report will contain a category called “impact_path” which shows the component path of  the discovered vulnerability.

Additionally, please run the Get Artifact Dependency Graph API call and share the results with me. Here’s an example of the JSON payload to include:

{"path" : "default/docker-local/jfrog/xray-rabbitmq/1.0.0"}

Lastly, if possible please provide me with the python package so that I can scan the package with my Xray instance.

I look forward to your response.

Extract of the log:2021-10-21T08:01:15.8056559Z The feed 'JFrogCli [https://artifactory.group.euroclear.com:15443/artifactory/api/nuget/v3/eoc-nuget-dev]' lists package 'NuGet.Frameworks.5.5.0' but multiple attempts to download the nupkg have failed. The feed is either invalid or required packages were removed while the current operation was in progress. Verify the package exists on the feed and try again.2021-10-21T08:01:15.8069487Z  Unable to find package 'NuGet.Frameworks.5.5.0'.2021-10-21T08:01:15.8562909Z NuGet.Protocol.Core.Types.FatalProtocolException: The feed 'JFrogCli [https://artifactory.group.euroclear.com:15443/artifactory/api/nuget/v3/eoc-nuget-dev]' lists package 'NuGet.Frameworks.5.5.0' but multiple attempts to download the nupkg have failed. The feed is either invalid or required packages were removed while the current operation was in progress. Verify the package exists on the feed and try again. ---> NuGet.Protocol.PackageNotFoundProtocolException: Unable to find package 'NuGet.Frameworks.5.5.0'.

Doing some debugging with the dotnet restore CLI, I noticed this behaviourWhen I have a correct feed defined in my Nuget.config, the dotnet restore can restore the package. config : <add key="ArtDevV3" value="https://artifactory.group.euroclear.com:15443/artifactory/api/nuget/v3/eoc-nuget-dev" protocolVersion="3" />When I have an incorrect package.config (missing protocolVersion="3") I have the same message as in the pipeline. config: <add key="ArtDevV3Bad" value="https://artifactory.group.euroclear.com:15443/artifactory/api/nuget/v3/eoc-nuget-dev" /> So I started the CI pipeline again, cancelled it during the restore to get the temporary nuget config generated by the CLI and noticed the feed is also missing protocolVersion="3". 
In the CI pipeline restore step, I also experimented overriding the config by adding the argument '--configfile ../nuget.config', pointing to a nuget.config with correct V3 protocol settings, and this time the temp nuget.config was not generated/used and the restore was done successfully. 
I referred already to the similar case we raised, 150390, where unfortunately we missed somehow in the validation if the issue was resolved. 
The issue is not noticed as long as the nuget packages to be restored are not SemVerLevel 2 versioned packages. eg. Nuget.Frameworks 5.0.0 and 5.5.0 are SemVerLevel 2, but 4.6.0 is not
I also noticed that when using a correct nuget.config V3, the communition with Artifactory is using a webrequest like (SUCCESS): GET https://artifactory.group.euroclear.com:15443/artifactory/api/nuget/v3/eoc-nuget-dev/registration-semver2/nuget.frameworks/index.json
While with an incorrect nuget.config (FAIL):GET https://artifactory.group.euroclear.com:15443/artifactory/api/nuget/v3/eoc-nuget-dev/FindPackagesById()?id='nuget.frameworks'&semVerLevel=2.0.0  
Could there still be an issue in the JFrog CLI in regards with ProtocolVersion 3 and nupgk in the SemVerLevel 2 format?

Hi Tomas,

Now this is kind of weird because I removed two sections from the values.yaml that referred to specific image registries as they were preventing me from running the install, and the values.yaml you sent to me worked. The two sections removed were



logger:

  image:

    registry: image-registry.***

    repository: busybox

    tag: 1.33.1







<within router block>

  image:

    registry: image-registry.***

    repository: router

    tag: 7.25.1

    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
and the output was



helm upgrade --install jfrog-platform jfrog-patch/jfrog-platform -f custom_values.yaml

Release "jfrog-platform" does not exist. Installing it now.

NAME: jfrog-platform

LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Oct 25 11:46:56 2021

NAMESPACE: default

STATUS: deployed

REVISION: 1

TEST SUITE: None

NOTES:

Congratulations. You have just deployed JFrog Platform Chart with following products:

- artifactory

- xray

.......
It might have been a different chart version or something to do with the helm version, but as it is now it looks like it works just fine.

02s6900002PAJrYAAX5006900003jaQrUAAURe: [#183726] Artifactory fails on fetching images from the remote container registriesHey Sunny,

hope you’re doing good! Appreciate your time helping us with this issue.

Please let me provide a bit more context here. Jfrog Artifactory is hosted in our internal network and it doesn’t require credentials to fetch(pull) images.

At the same time we have credentials for some of the used upstream repositories:
[cid:image001.jpg@01D7CA60.19DF6160]

For instance, we have credentials for such upstream like:
- docker-remote
- docker-remote-docker-hub

But not for other upstream container image repositories.



Hope this helps, please let me know if you need more context or you have any further questions. It might be reasonable to have a quick demo session if you need to have more details on the Artifactory configuration.

Thank you very much,
Pasha

02s6900002PAJsRAAX5006900003jaiNnAAI[#184078] Re: LDAP based authentication with user token and RBAC implementation.Hi Mihir, Nanda,
Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
In my answer below, I will assume that you mean for authentication using a user’s API key and not an access token (kindly let me know if you mean otherwise.
Authenticating LDAP users using the user’s API key is possible only if the “Auto Create Users) is enabled in the LDAP settings. The API key is saved under the internal user entity in Artifactory, so the user must exist in Artifactory and not only in the LDAP server for this to work. The user also must be placed under a specific group.
Please note that API key authentication will work only for REST API/JFrog CLI calls and not for UI authentication.
I hope this helps.

Some of our pipelines are working with in-house Nuget packages that are stored in Nuget repos in Artifactory.
It seems like when downloading these packages, Artifactory keeps some caching packages locally under: %USERPROFILE%\.nuget\packages.
And we found ourselves deleting these folder from time to time as it consume high disk space.

Is there a way to avoid Artifactory downloading these packages to this folder?

02s6900002PAJumAAH5006900003jaksrAAAUsing XRAY to scan vehicle ECU binaries for vulnerabilitiesHi

We've upgrade to Artifactory 7, XRAY 3 and are exploring use of XRAY to scan for vulnerabilities in vehicle ECU binaries.

Specifically we are checking if CI pipelines can cover a corporate standard that refers to encryption strength.

In the past I used another SAST tool which could identify the specific CWE that relates to encryption strength
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html

See https://help.veracode.com/r/c_review_cwe

How can we translate how XRAY manages CVE levels to pass/fail via pipeline ?

If you have any case studies on CI pipelines for vehicle domain DevSecOps please share

Thanks

Mike.

02s6900002PAJxlAAH5006900003jai8XAAQ[#184069] Artifactory Support RequestHi Kenneth,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

To begin, please notice that I have split the Support Ticket in the following way:

184069 - Artifactory issue
184159 - Support Portal UI issue

Therefore, we will handle the Artifactory issue in this ticket.

I noticed that you mentioned this is your Artifactory production instance. As it’s currently down, we might want to mark the ticket as critical - please let me know if that’s indeed the case.

From past experience, it’s possible that your server patching (yum update) has upgraded the JDK to ‘1.8.0_292-8u292’, which is known to cause issues with Artifactory 6.x.

You can quickly check if that’s the use case by executing ‘java -version’ in the Artifactory VM. If the problematic version is installed, you’ll need to downgrade the JDK, as mentioned in the link above.

If your JDK version hasn’t changed during the ‘yum upgrade’, please provide me with the following information for further investigation:

1. A copy of the Artifactory log directory ($ARTIFACTORY_HOME/logs)
2. A copy of the Artifactory Access log directory ($ARTIFACTORY_HOME/access/log)
3. The output of the ‘java -version’ command

You can send me the files using the following cURL command:

$ curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184069/"

I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

02s6900002PAJzDAAX5006900003YfVgXAAVRe: [#182874] LDAP issue - SSL certificateHello David,

Please share the finding after sniffing the LDAP's port.
Furthermore, I've tested a similar scenario in my lab environment, and it appears that the exact same error is raised when an incorrect manager DN's password is used, with that being said, could you please verify the validity of the manager DN password? My suspicion is that this password has been changed recently and eventually led us to this unexpected issue.
Please verify this on your end and keep me updated with the result.

As agreed during the cal, we'll schedule another call tomorrow,  click here to book a session with me.

About the logs there are 2 options:
1. The preferable and easier way is to generate a full support bundle via the UI or using REST API (see here).
2. Manually collect and zip:

02s6900002PAK4rAAH5006900003YfF3BAAVRE: [#182520] MSB PDN BETA: Unable to enable PDNHi John,
Good to talk to you yesterday.
Manually replacing the two mentioned schemas has yielded yet more missing relations. It would appear that the HA instance is missing 24 tables and the edge is missing 21 compared to a functioning instance of Artifactory.
Despite the database, PVC and secrets being deleted/wiped and reinstalled, it would appear that Artifactory isn't treating the instance as a new install and therefore not creating the required tables.

Kindest regards,
-Grant

Hi Team,

Unfortunately, I won't be available to join the session today due to the other critical call. However, I do believe I figured out what going on with the keys mismatch and was not able to pass the configuration through system.yaml within the values.yaml files.

The reason was caused by the secrets that were created by artifactory-ha helm (including system.yaml), hence, we will need to remove these, and redeploy them. I have expanded the session to 30 mins tomorrow, and will also be available the majority of the time this afternoon (EST). Let me know if the team able to jump into a call with us today, or we can wait till tomorrow. Thanks.

Best regards,
John Chiao

I am trying to use Docker Content Trust with a notary service. I see you have documented the procedure as well
https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Working+with+Docker+Content+Trust

However I have a query. In my setup the image is eventually downloaded from edge node and not directly from the dev artifactory.
The edge node has a different domain than dev artifactory. With these constraints do you have any recommendations or documentation which I can refer.

I'd prefer to go the less easy way and bring this system to operation again rather than doing a clean install.
My thoughts here are such way that I'll get a bit more experience in this area and I'll have a "blue print" in case something fails when being faced by an operating system upgrade on the Xray production environment being automatically performed by the internal IT's automation tool stack. (This should not happen as this system is in an exclusion list, but history has shown the sentence "all what can go wrong will go wrong" is a quite self fulfilling prophecy...)
Kind regardsTim

02s6900002PAK72AAH5006900003YgTnNAAV[#183653] Xray unable to scan due to disk space usage errorHi Eric,

Thank you for sharing the command output with me.

I have further reviewed the logs and noticed that the pax-sparse-big.tar file contains a 60GB file within it so when Xray tries to index it, it is downloading it locally and is running out of storage space. It is also likely that during this file’s indexing process, other files/ artifacts are being indexed as well and therefore, Xray runs out of available disk space.

In order to resolve this issue, I recommend increasing the Xray disk size as you suggested earlier and in order to determine how large your disk size should be, you may refer to our Xray System Requirements page.

I hope you find this information useful.

Best regards,
Daniel Poterman

通过分析你提供的日志，我们发现一下两个问题：

1、export/import

2021-10-25 14:11:50,840 [art-exec-36] [INFO ] (o.a.s.a.ArchiveIndexerImpl:146) - Indexing archive: libs-release-local:com/didichuxing/blueone/baseinfo-interface/1.2.0/baseinfo-interface-1.2.0-sources.jar

org.jfrog.storage.binstore.exceptions.BinaryNotFoundException: Binary provider has no content for '1e99915fc7eb8b13cd9022c33055bb6488ff7210'

这表明导入的只是索引，没有实际导入制品包文件。

请提供以下信息以进一步确认：
1） Export的具体设置，是否导出了制品文件
2）如果导出了制品文件，请确认存储（从日志看是S3存储）连接是否正常，空间是否被占满，导出的制品文件是否存储到了S3里

2. 启动

org.jfrog.access.client.AccessClientHttpException: HTTP response status 404:Failed on executing /api/v1/system/ping, with response: Not Found

这表明有组件没有正常启动。

请提供以下信息以进一步确认：
1）系统是如何停止的，是否所有组件都正常停止了？
2）系统是如何启动的，是否启动了所有的组件？

我们将根据你的反馈做进一步的调查。

谢谢。

02s6900002PAK8UAAX5006900003YfNu2AAF[#182706] Access Federation from external Mission Control IssuesHi Hap and team,

Thanks for meeting with me yesterday.

On the call we were troubleshooting the Access Federation issues on the AWS environments.
At the beginning of the call, we saw that full-broadcast from US to EU is working, while any live events are not getting synced.
On the other hand, we suspected that there is inconsistency in the syncs between EU to US, where it felt as it's partially working.

We were able to resolve the live sync from US to EU by restarting the US cluster nodes.
I have informed you that it is crucial to restart the nodes of a cluster after an Access import.
It is a known behaviour for JFrog that after access import, a restart is required for Access Federation to work. In case this step was not shared with you in the past, apologies.
It is also mentioned as the final step in this knowledge base article.

I have reviewed the Support bundle from the US cluster, and from the logs I can confirm there was no restart of the US nodes since "2021-10-19T18:39:25.273Z" on node "ip-10-213-15-156.ec2.internal" and "2021-10-19T18:41:40.622Z" on node "ip-10-213-14-22.ec2.internal".
This is while I believe the access import was on "2021-10-19T19:45", a bit later. I can see in the logs you ran the full_broadcast, however, a restart is missing.
I am confident that the lack of restart, which I can confirm from the logs, is the reason Access Federation wasn't syncing live events.

With regards to the partial sync issues from EU to US, we confirmed these were due to group dependency missing on some users and such. A full broadcast resolved these.

With regards to the REALM not updating as part of the full broadcast, I informed you that this is most likely due to the "modified" timestamp of the user entity being unmodified.
When the target Access server receives the users with the modified REALM, it checks for the modified timestamp. It will accept the change only when the modified timestamp is newer. This is why applying any other change on the users does trigger that sync.
As suggested, you will also update the modified date upon changing the REALM, and will let us know if this resolves this problem.

Waiting forward to hearing from you today.

Best regards,
Ariel Kabov

02s6900002PAK8ZAAX5006900003jafsdAAA[#184033] Xray report for special filenamesHello Norbert,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.
To answer the above query yes you can create Xray report for specific filename set in a folder.

While generating the report, please add the ‘Include Path Pattern’ as : repository-name/parentfolder/subfolder/
and by adding a patten in
Below is the artifact I have in my artifactory under the path org/postgresql/postgresql/9.4.1212/

Now, I have created a report as below with a include pattern "/org/postgresql/postgresql/9.4.1212/"


And under vulnerable component, I have the file name with postfix or prefix. In your case, it would be *-RELEASE


We can also have a pattern in Impacted Artifact.

Hope this clarifies your query. Let us know if you have any further questions. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

02s6900002PAK8kAAH5006900003K1LyMAAVRe: [#176603] Nuget restore failing permanentlyHi Michael,

Thanks for the update.

Based on this metadata, it looks like the artifact exists in Artifactory with the expected Nupkg information. This being said, I’d like to get on another call to further investigate this issue.

Before the call, please add the Nuget debuggers to the logback.xml once again and rerun the pipeline. Please add the following before the last </configuration> tag:

    <appender name="nuget" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <File>${log.dir}/artifactory-nuget.log</File>
        <rollingPolicy class="org.jfrog.common.logging.logback.rolling.FixedWindowWithDateRollingPolicy">
            <FileNamePattern>${log.dir.archived}/artifactory-nuget.%i.log.gz</FileNamePattern>
        </rollingPolicy>
        <triggeringPolicy class="org.jfrog.common.logging.logback.triggering.SizeAndIntervalTriggeringPolicy">
            <MaxFileSize>25MB</MaxFileSize>
        </triggeringPolicy>
        <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.core.encoder.LayoutWrappingEncoder">

    </appender>
 
<logger name="org.artifactory.addon.nuget" additivity="false">
<level value="debug"/>
<appender-ref ref="nuget"/>
</logger>

After the build is complete (ie failed) please provide us with a Support Bundle with the time of error. Next, remove the debuggers to prevent performance issues.

Once this is complete, please schedule a call using the link here.

I look forward to your update.

Thanks for your response. I tested the 'failFast': false option on my test setup and got the following results:First Build / Upload / Promote (with empty repository)The frist build upload and promote still works fine without issues just like before.Second Build / Upload / Promote (with artifacts from previous build)With the failFast flag even this build could be promoted without overwrite permissions which did not work before.
Since everything works as desired in my little test setup i will try again to run a test with my real project (more aritfacts) and write here again if that works aswell. But i think since my problems are gone in the test setup that should work too.

Thank you for reaching out.

Currently there are no plans to implement MSI type repositories in Artifactory. This being said, you can use the generic repository for storing the zipped MSI artifacts.

Regarding the repository layout, this depends on requirements from Octopus deploy. We don’t provide official support for this third party integration. If Octopus only supports Nuget and Maven formats, you can deploy the zipped artifacts to Maven or Nuget repositories (using the default Maven/Nuget layouts) and connect these to Octopus. Please attempt this and update me on the result.

I look forward to your update.

Thank you for your patience while I was reviewing the new log files.

Going over the logs, I wasn’t able to find any new information regarding the timeout issues you encounter.

It appears that the request is being sent from Artifactory to the LDAP server but the response is not returned which is resulting with the timeout error.

As a next step I recommend tracing or pinging the connection between Artifactory and the LDAP server when the error occurs to further investigate where the connection issue may reside.

In addition, I am also trying to set up a similar environment to reproduce the error internally.

Thank you for your reply.

As I cannot see anything concrete in the logs that might indicate an issue, it is hard to determine what exactly happened and what was the exact flow on Artifactory side (both edge and source instances).
Were you able to reproduce the issue? Did you see any image not being updated after the cache expiry?
If the behaviour is reproducible, we can further investigate it by possibly adding debug logging and checking the logs from both instances.

[ External sender. Exercise caution. ]

Hello Graeme,

In the session, we first discussed the usePresigning settings. The 5GB limit is on AWS single request limit and it can't be changed. For now, we suggest to first disabling usePresigning setting in binarystore.xml.

We also found out that there are some settings issues with buildInfo replication and after tunning the configDescriptors, we are able to replicate buildInfo.

In logs, we are still seeing many 413 request entity too large error. We have modified tomcat and nginx settings but it still didn't help. Since we noticed that the disk space is filling up more than 95%, we suggest to first trying to scale up disk space and artifactory could also throw 413 error when there's not enough diskspace.

If you still see issues after disabling presigning and with enough disk space, please reach out to us. Thank you.

02s6900002PAKHHAA55006900003jacy7AAA[#183990] Need only 443 port for JFrog NLBHi Prajwal,

Thank you for joining the session with us today.
Over the session, you explained to us by default the NLB is using both 80 and 443 ports as a listener. Due to security reasons, you have to use only 443 port and as suggested, you have disabled port 80 at the load balancer level by updating the active listeners on the NLB by removing port 80 on the load balancer configuration. We reproduced the issue by hitting the load balancer URL where the URL failed to forward the request to Artifactory.  We modified the values.yaml config file to have the https backend traffic and we made sure to have the https port enabled then performed the helm upgrade and still the issue persisted. As a test, we enabled the http port by updating the values.yaml and when we hit the the LB URL, the request forwarded to Artifactory as expected.
https://github.com/jfrog/charts/blob/master/stable/artifactory-ha/values.yaml#L1916

As discussed in the session, we will further check with our internal team on the reported issue and we will keep you posted with findings.

How do I pack the msi file in TeamCity with zip and upload to JFrog maven repository.

Subject: [External][#184045] Artifactory Layouts and Repository structure requirement

Hi Hari,

Thank you for reaching out.

Currently there are no plans to implement MSI type repositories in Artifactory. This being said, you can use the generic repository for storing the zipped MSI artifacts.

Regarding the repository layout, this depends on requirements from Octopus deploy. We don’t provide official support for this third party integration. If Octopus only supports Nuget and Maven formats, you can deploy the zipped artifacts to Maven or Nuget repositories (using the default Maven/Nuget layouts) and connect these to Octopus. Please attempt this and update me on the result.

I look forward to your update.

Thank you for your patience.
I looked into this Jira voting issue with the relevant team and it appears to be a Jira limitation related to the Jira status, where Jiras can be voted to only if the status is “open” (“reopened” status does not allow the option to vote even though the Jira is technically open). I do not have the option to vote for it as well.
That being said, kindly note that this Jira is already under review of the relevant teams and the voting (or lack of votes) does not affect its review status.
I hope this clarifies. I will proceed to close this ticket, please feel free to open a new ticket should you require our assistance in the future, we will be happy to assist.

I couldn't reproduce this on my end, at Artifactory startup I could see that it gets encrypted.
I also tried to update the password and do a restart and it got encrypted again.

Are you sure you have artifactory key encryption enabled ?
Did Artifactory start correctly without issues? Artifactory needs to be up and running in order to encrypt it.

As a side note, you can also harden this method and not expose the file at all by using this method.

 从日志看，应用启动时，普通用户无DDL的权限，执行了create table的命令失败。

 请协助解决切换普通数据库用户启动应用失败问题，如应用连接数据库用户必须配置DDL权限启动，请说明理由。

Subject: AW: [#183905] PGP signature is preserved via repote NPM repos?

Hi Tatarao,

to make use of the npm-Signing Feature, so that Standard tools might validate packages, the npm-signature has to be available on Api-Level.

How would it help to find the signature in the json file mentioned? Do you have a recommendation for manual validation?

Regards
Patrick

Betreff: [#183905] PGP signature is preserved via repote NPM repos?

Hi Imre,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to your query about NPM artifacts, Artifactory stores this information in Metadata file of that artifact which is located under .npm folder of the repository. Here is screenshot from our lab environment and its relevant link : http://art.local/artifactory/npm-remote/.npm/light-cycle/light-cycle-1.4.3.json<https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fart.local%2Fartifactory%2Fnpm-remote%2F.npm%2Flight-cycle%2Flight-cycle-1.4.3.json&data=04%7C01%7Cimre.pem%40evosoft.com%7Ca86ee3806415404fa10b08d9977b3ee4%7C38ae3bcd95794fd4addab42e1495d55a%7C1%7C0%7C637707377853929307%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=fU5gD53ypao27u23Lwh%2FW6I2ZLuqFkTwwX1iu6wyBQQ%3D&reserved=0>

02s6900002PAKODAA55006900003YgLuhAAFRe: [#183479] Fwd: Issue with SAML and API KeyHi Amith,

Sorry for the late reply, I've take a deeper look today.
My account belongs to a group (named APP-Repox-admin) which has admin
right, when I'm logging in with this account I can see the administration
panel and administrate the platform.

In the following screenshot I'm logged with the IdP :
[image: image.png]

In this screenshot, I do have the correct rights (even if the flag "Admin"
is unticked) due to the appartenance on APP-Repox-Admin group that does not
appear here.
When I try to do administrative work with curl, it's failing :

❯ curl -H "X-JFrog-Art-Api:xxx"
> https://repox.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/security/users
> {
>   "errors" : [ {
>     "status" : 403,
>     "message" : "Forbidden"
>   } ]
> }%
>

As soon as I add the Admin flag for this user, it works (same API key) :

❯ curl -H "X-JFrog-Art-Api:xxxx"
> https://repox.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/security/users
> [ {
>   "name" : "private-reader",
>   "uri" : "
> https://repox.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/security/users/private-reader",
>   "realm" : "internal"
> }, {
>

It's the same issue for accessing any resource (again same API key)  :

> ❯ curl -H "X-JFrog-Art-Api:xxxx"
> https://repox.jfrog.io/artifactory/sonarsource-private-releases/com/sonarsource/branch/sonar-branch/1.0.0.507/sonar-branch-1.0.0.507.pom
> {
>   "errors" : [ {
>     "status" : 403,
>     "message" : "Download request for repo:path
> 'sonarsource-private-releases:com/sonarsource/branch/sonar-branch/1.0.0.507/sonar-branch-1.0.0.507.pom'
> is forbidden for user: 'eric.hartmann@sonarsource.com'."
>   } ]
> }%
>

If I manually add the user to the group given by SAML, it works :

> ❯ curl -H "X-JFrog-Art-Api:xxxx"
> https://repox.jfrog.io/artifactory/sonarsource-private-releases/com/sonarsource/branch/sonar-branch/1.0.0.507/sonar-branch-1.0.0.507.pom
> <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
>          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
>          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
> http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
>   <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
>

So if my understanding is correct, the main issue is that the group given
during the login is not persisted in the database,
Anyway, we can now set up SCIM, and hopefully the persistence will be
available through SCIM instead of SAML.

Cheers,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
My name is Andrey and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

That was what I was looking for. So an update like

would work.

Sorry I should have clarified in the initial message.
internal-jar-signed is composed of local internal repositories only, no remote repositories
Looking in the advanced settings I could not see the metadata retrieval ttl settings as these aren't remote repositories.
Does that leave zap-cache as the only option for the signed virtual repo?
Thanks

Thank you for the response.

From the shared screenshot,


It looks like the storage allocated for Cache FS(/opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/data/artifactory/cache) is full, as a next step, we highly recommend you to increase the cache fs size. From the previously observed error, the stack trace that the cache-fs is not performing well. By increasing the cache-fs size we might overcome any cache miss events and will possibly reduce the requests going to the S3 for all the events to get a large file.

From the shared binareystore.xml file,

The maxCacheSize allocated is around 200 GB. You can try increasing the cache-fs size to another 50 to 100 GB, restart the Artifactory and let us know if you are still observing similar behaviour.

Hi David,

Thank you for reaching out.
Artifactory is coming bundled with tomcat with a specific version, upgrading it manually is not supported,  this is only the configuration that we support.
Can you please elaborate on which security vulnerabilities we discuss?
I ask since we do provide support with mitigating those and SLA for vulnerabilities that depend on the severity of such.

I will appreciate it if you can share the relevant CVE's and the security tools used to find those.

  1.  detail step by step the actions you took to upgrade Artifactory to 7.27.3

Stop the current server:
[root@04EUW1ARTIWS01A /]# service artifactory stop
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl stop artifactory.service
[root@04EUW1ARTIWS01A /]#

*         To get a list of all available versions run:

If you had a reverse proxy or load balancer configured with your Artifactory 6.x, you will need to create a new reverse proxy configuration and update your reverse proxy settings.
You can generate a new configuration template by accessing the upgraded Artifactory server UI (by default http://localhost:8082/ui/), navigate to Administration > Artifactory > General > HTTP Settings adjust your Reverse Proxy Settings and generate a new configuration template.

tail -f $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/log/console.log



2.       Zip up and upload the 'log' and 'etc' directories from $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/var/ is uploaded.


Please, keep in mind that we are not using HA, we have one host, running Artifactory.

As previously said, our builds are not scanned with Xray, and artifacts are scanned only after they are deployed.I can confirm that both packages you mentioned are physically present in artifactory, but only cucumber:0.2.9 is scanned (see images).
I am available for a call together with the developer responsible of the npm packages previously mentioned. Unfortunately the developer responsible for those maven artifacts is not reachable today.
Tomorrow 27/10 from 14:30 to 17 CET would suit us. Is it ok for you?

02s6900002PAKViAAP5006900003jahCeAAI[#184055] Crash of Xray Service when try to setupHello Guillaume,

Thank you for reaching out.

Please note that setting up Artifactory and Xray on the same host is extremely discouraged. In addition to possible port conflicts, such scenarios may result in performance bottlenecks due to Xray's resource-intensive nature, as per our official documentation.
Because environments that host more than one product have not been properly tested and may produce unforeseen edge issues, I strongly advise establishing up a separate hosting machine for each product.

If you are unable to follow through on the above recommendation, please share with me the following information for further analysis:

Hosting machine's specifications (RAM, CPU, etc.)
Artifactory and Xray installation types (Debian, RPM, Docker Compose, etc.)
Artifactory and Xray /logs directory archive along with the system.yaml of each product (the attached system.yaml has indentation omitted)


You may upload files cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:

curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184055/"

02s6900002PAKWvAAP5006900003Yf8CNAAZ[#182354] Fwd: Jrog to AZURE AD issueHi Evgeny,

Thank you for joining today's session.

Please allow me to share with you that I have further checked this internally, and please note that we should enable both - SAML and SCIM.
Apologize for the misunderstanding.
The reason we were not able to properly login is due to the reason I mentioned above as SAML SSO is for Authentication of the user and SCIM Provisioning of users/groups/user-group relation. SCIM only knows sending requests and not handling requests as SAML does.

To sum up:

We should enable SAML on the Artifactory side
We should verify that the SAML SSO settings are set correctly.

I am suspecting that the redirect you mentioned earlier may be related to the 'SAML Logout URL'. Please copy the URL configured in 'SAML Login URL' and pasted it in the 'SAML Logout URL' and save the configuration.
Or, alternatively, you can configure the 'SAML Logout URL' as follows:

https://meitav.jfrog.io/login






Once the configuration was saved successfully, we should log in to Artifactory using the 'SAML' icon and pick the user 'evgenym@meitavdash.co.il'.



In addition, after testing the above on my environment, I got a better understanding that when we are logging through SAML (as we should do) the Realm value will be set to 'saml', however, when an update is being pushed by SCIM, the value will become 'scim'.

I hope this helps.
And, again,  I apologize for the confusion that has happened.
Please perform the above steps and share the results with us.
Looking for your updates.

Best regards,
Noy Badani

02s6900002PAKXzAAP5006900003YgMpJAAV[#183510] Advance filters does not works in XRAY scanHi Pawan,

Thank you for your reply.

You can check the Xray version in the UI by navigating to the Admin module --> monitoring --> service status.
This will show information regarding the Xray service connected to this Artifactory including it's version.

Regarding the REST API, please change the url that you are using from 'v2' to 'v1', i.e:

curl -GET -u_svc-user_art:******** https://artifactory-us.cadenttech.tv/xray/api/v1/reports/export/26?file_name=2021_10_20_platform_docker_repo&format=pdf

Please let me know if this succeeds as we need to know if the issue is exclusive to the UI download or REST API fails as well.

I look forward to your update.

About your answer, for the first point, this is exactly what we want. Being able to give permission on repository level like on the administration panel (As on your screenshot).

For the second point (creation of env on the fly), is this feature is on your road map? Did you plan on your side to provide this kind of feature in the future?
Thanks.

02s6900002PAKhoAAH5006900003jaRsjAAE[#183743] Upgrade artifactory to 7 from 6.22.0Hello Hudson/Beryl,

Hope you folks are doing good. Please find responses to your questions below:

Question 1): Can we go ahead and upgrade directly to the latest release? Version 7.27.3?
JFrog Support): If you have recently upgraded to Artifactory version 6.23.31 we would recommend that you upgrade to version 7.21.3 and then plan for the latest version.

Question 2): Are the hardware requirements cumulative? Artifactory required cores + Mission Control required cores + Xray required cores + etc.
JFrog Support): From JFrog Artifactory version 7.27.3, Mission Control has been integrated directly into Artifactory as a service. You no longer need to install Mission Control to use the features it provides. You must enable the service in Artifactory through the Artifactory system YAML file. For more information, please see the
documentation. However, for Artifactory and Xray it is recommended to use a dedicated server, best is to refer to System Requirements for information on requirements.

Question 3): Docs say AJP connector is unsupported but not how to fix it, how do we fix it?
JFrog Support): AJP Connector has been removed and will no longer work, HTTP should be used as an alternative. You can also refer to Release Notes for countering this breaking change.

Question 4): Our current DB is db.m5.8xlarge I could see no recommendation for DB changes when upgrading to Artifactory 7. Is there a recommended hardware bump? We are also running Postgresql v10.17 on an external DB,
JFrog Support): There is no such hardware recommendation for DB however for Artifactory 7.x to run with PostgreSQL you must create a dedicated PostgreSQL database instance and then configure Artifactory to use it as described on this confluence page.

Question 5): Rollback Artifactory upgrade
JFrog Support): If rolling back an Artifactory upgrade is necessary, you'll need to reinstall an older version of Artifactory and load a database backup. Here is a knowledge base article for reference.

Please feel free to revert if I have missed anything or more information is needed on any of the above points.
We look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
I configured the below and was able to get this working.


Kindly make sure that the package is not present in the local npm under the virtual repository and is not cached in the npm remote.
If the issue still persists kindly send me an Artifactory Support Bundle for further review.

Please note that the package.json was pulled but the tgz/binary file was not cached
If it is less than 5 MB, you may send the files directly to us using Support Portal or email.
Otherwise, you may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:
curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184065/"
No username and password are required.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

My name is Andrey and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

With regards to the reported behavior, I would like to better understand the current use case, what is the desired result, what information you are seeking to receive by the mentioned curl command?

As the curl command hangs I want to verify the communication between the Artiactory and the host on which the Curl is installed, please let me know if you were able to get a response from Artifactory by running the System Health Ping REST API for example.

Looking forward to your update.

02s6900002PAKk9AAH5006900003YgTaqAAF[#183643] pregunta @fileHi Ronald,

Thank you for getting back to me.

Prior setting up a session, based on the last output you shared (400 error) I suspect that the issue is with Tomcat not allowing encoded slashes, which fail requests for the scoped packages. Please see the below wiki for reference:

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/npm+Registry#npmRegistry-npmScopePackages

Please try resolving the issue by adding the below line to the 'catalina.properties' file (the file is found under $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/app/artifactory/tomcat/conf/ folder):

org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH=true

Please note to add it in all the nodes of the cluster. A restart of each node is needed for the change to take affect.

Let me know if this solves the issue, I look forward to your update.

Best regards,
Oron Chalaf

02s6900002PAKlHAAX5006900003jaULMAA2Re: [#183792] Register Platform Deployment fails with connectivity issueI'm working with the suggested tests however I ran into some other issues. When I tried to ping an Artifactory instance, I couldn't get reach the instance so I checked Artifactory state on that server. Artifactory was stopped because jf-router was not running and it has the error: "Cluster join: Retry 5: Service registry ping failed, will retry. Error: could not parse error from service registry, status code: 404, raw body: <!doctype html><html lang="en"><head><title>HTTP Status 404"I restarted the Artifactory service and rebooted multiple times. My join key and master key are in files not in the system.yaml.So I investigated this side issue to restore connection and I saw that join.keys were different on my servers and went ahead to make them the same.To sum up I have one question regarding join keys: On one of the working server I set a random hex number into the join.key file and that random hex number changed to: JEUkGn7qb3JdbiC2M4NosYErLMyASi6HUDsJPYw9D5E35LC4HYCUEEheRycja1DffEqfBCdmf4DZGkDHUAh3VkWTpEVTP
On my other server I created the a random hex number with the same command, put it into the join.key file and after starting Artifactory it changed to:32c7c2.aesgcm256.-wwrjHWL-rnyJL-rfWEkGa72NFjLkuwTrVEK90qNrAoJg4IVuM0vg31m-njfLRMCMdVJrlMq-F6FbO6vTQ
These two look totally different in structure. What is the reason behind this? With the second key, the respective server couldn't start.I'm aware that Artifactory encodes the key in the join.key file but which format is right? Shall I recreate the first key?Is it possible to set Artifactory not to be "smart" and not to join anything just start up? If Artifactory cannot start because of a wrong join.key, what is the suggested method to change the join.key from the GUI if Artifactory is not accessible?

From the logs, we could infer that the Xray DB sync and the scans were working as expected and suddenly started failing with the above errors. The pattern appears in a way that the Xray service was able to serve the requests as expected for quite some time and it abruptly started to fail the requests. We have observer a similar pattern of error in the past due to resource issues and DB issues. We would request you to share with us how the database was installed and if there are any errors logged on the same. Can you confirm if the database is a single node or if it's a cluster?

Looking forward to your response.

02s6900002PAKtBAAX5006900003YgTpuAAF[#183656] Error Syncing LDAP GroupsHi Jennifer,

Based on the shared screenshots, it appears that the group cloudbees_cds_team_admins is assigned with the Project Admins role. Can you tell if this group currently has any members? If it does, when you log in with one of the group members, are you able to perform any tasks within the CDS-Team project such as creating roles, adding other members to the project etc?


If you are, it means that the group was assigned with the proper permissions for this project.

If not, it is worth checking the group to see if the members are being added to it when they log in for the first time. In order to do so, please navigate to the Administration tab >> Identity and Access >> Groups and verify the group members.


I hope you find this information useful.

02s6900002PAKtGAAX5006900003Yg7kkAAB[#183216] Federated repo fails to mirror packagesHi Donald,

Thank you for your patience.

Firstly, I see that you’re configuring the Federated Repositories using the federatedRepoUrlBase. This is only relevant in cases where you’re using Geo Synchronized Topology where all of the Custom URLs must be identical.

From the logs provided, you have configured the Federated Repositories with two different URLS:

https://staging.repo.splunkdev.net/artifactory
https://primary-leader.staging.repo.splunkdev.net/artifactory/

Based on this, please use the <BASE_URL> configuration (in place of federatedRepoUrlBase) and retry the configuration. Please be sure to remove the federatedRepoUrlBase as well.

If the issue persists, please provide me with the following information:

Ensure that there is time synchronization between the instances
Each instance has a different base url configured
There’s a circle of trust between the instances
Exact steps taken to create the Federation
Execute the Update Access Federation API request. Here’s an example of how the command should be called:

$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -XPOST "http://<artifactory_host>/access/api/v1/system/federation/validate_server" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"url\": \"http://<artifactory_host>/access/\"}" -i

I look forward to your update.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

I have thoroughly inspected the Artifactory and Xray Support Bundles you shared with me and was able to find the following requests to Xray’s ‘/api/v1/summary/artifact’:

2021-10-25T15:17:12+02:00|10.245.146.113|admin|POST|/api/v1/summary/artifact|200|95|12720.018668

To begin, please notice that these requests do not appear to be sent to Artifactory, meaning that they are handled completely by Xray.

According to the right-most column of the above requests, it takes Xray about 12,000 to 15,000 milliseconds (12-15 seconds) to respond to the API call, which makes me wonder why it takes another ~50 seconds for the response to arrive at the cURL client.

Unfortunately, Xray’s default log verbosity does not provide any additional information about this specific API call. However, we can take the following steps to gather more information:

1. Execute the same cURL command to the internal Xray address (http://localhost:8000/api/v1/summary/artifact), bypassing the reverse proxy. This will help us understand if the slowness is related to the reverse proxy.

2. Increase the log verbosity and reproduce the issue:
A: In the Xray machine, locate a file called “server_log4go_config.xml”, usually located under “/var/opt/jfrog/xray/data/config/”
B: Change ‘<level>INFO</level>’ to: ‘<level>DEBUG</level>’ and save the file (no need to restart)
C: Execute the cURL command once more
D: Provide me with a copy of Xray’s ‘request.log’ and most importantly ‘xray_server.log’

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Joey Naor

Thank you for reaching out.

After 7.3x, the ‘Edit User Profile’ option in the UI is disabled by default due to security concerns.

When adding a new user, this option should be checked in order to allow the user to edit their profile:


For instructions on how to edit this option for all existing users, please reference this KB article (please edit the script based on your needs).

Additionally, if you’re looking to generate a new API key for a specific user, this can be done for a specific user via the Regenerate API Key REST call.

I hope this clarifies.

I have been waiting for 30 min in the session bridge.

Following the above, please click here to book a session with JFrog Support Team.

Additionally, I noticed, in the attached screenshot, that you attempted to perform 'Zapp the cache' to a folder within the directory rather than the repository directory (remote or virtual repository where the 'XEditor global' directory is located in). Therefore, please click on the repository directory and attempt to re-scan the build.

Looking for your updates.

02s6900002PAKvbAAH5006900003YdXnrAAF[#181227] Xray fails to sync databaseHello Denis,

To investigate the issue reported concerning Xray DB sync, we would like to gather a few more details along with complete logs of Xray which will be helpful to troubleshoot and understand the root cause of this behaviour.

1. Please let us know the DISK size, memory and IOPS allocated for the PostgreSQL database, could you please check if the allocated storage meets the Minimal requirements for the node running PostgreSQL as mentioned in our wiki page for Xray? If not, we request you to increase the storage allocated for the PostgreSQL database. Below is the recommendation for the PostgreSQL database.

>> 4 CPU cores,
>> 30 GB of RAM
>> 300 GB disk
>> 3000 IOPS value

2. Enable debug logging for Xray, please add the following snippet to your system.yaml file (located in $JFROG_HOME/Xray/var/etc/)

server:

    logging:

        application:

            level: debug

After applying changes and abort the DBsync from UI, then perform a restart of Xray, resume the sync, and eventually, the daily sync should be triggering in the backend.

3. Once the DBsync is started, share the latest logs by generating a new Xray support bundle and the output of the screenshot of the below directories.

Directories:

ls -ltr $JFROG_HOME/var/work/server/updates/component

ls -ltr $JFROG_HOME/var/work/server/updates/vulnerabilities


4. Also, share us with the output of the updates table by accessing the Xray's PostgreSQL database
select * from updates;


5.You may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account using the below command:

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/181227/"

In addition, please elaborate further regarding the environment that Xray is running on so we can better narrow down the issue.


Looking forward to hearing back from you.

the solution you provide we use already as workaround but with a little bit different command because with your command artifactory doesnt start successfullInstead@reboot /ebs/jfrog/artifactory/app/bin/artifactoryManage.sh start

we use@reboot cd /ebs/jfrog/artifactory/app/bin && /ebs/jfrog/artifactory/app/bin/artifactoryManage.sh start

But it is no accepted solution for us, because for e.g. all our server monitoring looks for services and not for processes run by cron at startup.

  > Yes, I am sure I followed procedure.

re - import logs -- if you mean log levels changed to debug to get more verbose logs?


also, I hadn't attach logs from instance from where I had exported the system. let me send you that.


also,

What we are looking for is --  binary store content (artifacts) does not show up - We were told data is independent of system configuration import/export and a mere sync of s3 buckets should start showing artifacts on target instance.

02s6900002PAL4TAAX5006900003YgZSaAAN[#183707] Xray tuning - confirm parametersHi Micaela,

Thanks for your reply.

From below logs, I could see both actual size and max size is same at few places.

"2021-10-25T00:58:45.309Z [33m[jfxan][0m [34m[INFO ][0m [4f5a418da8fedfe9] [impact_service:139            ] [main                ]

"2021-10-24T23:53:14.861Z [33m[jfxan][0m [34m[INFO ][0m [f2f65498dccc26ae] [impact_service:139            ] [main                ] 
impact_analysis_stats: Comps cache: total = 881155, hit ratio = 67%, maxSize = 100000, actualSize = 100000","2021-10-25T10:53:17.199+1100",100000,,serverless,"edot_artifactory_xray_prod",1,100000,"--::._[[][_[[_][_[]_[:____________]_[_____________","67%","xray-analysis-service-i-009e16d350c9d591b","xray-prod-analysis-logs","splunk-idxc-9.splunk.ext.national.com.au",,,,881155

The max_size is the configured limit. If the actual_size is reaching the max_size in many incidents then we might see low hit ratios and we might consider increasing the max_size (the cache size). What matters here is the actual_size which means to what size the cache did reach during the processing of the impact analysis, messages.

I request you to check if the Xray instance has enough memory on this machine. The cache is kept per worker so if we increase the number of workers we should be careful. As you don't have any issues with the current configuration(impactAnalysis.componentsCache.maxSize=300000 and Impact Analysis Workers new_content value to 2), you can keep these values for now.

The other configuration parameter disableDockerImpactCheckCache as true should remain same and in one of the latest versions we made this as default value.

I hope this information helps, please let me know if you have any further queries.

Tatarao Vana

Hi,

Server on-prem (if reside on intel) can’t be reached out from public internet. It is impossible. For that we need to place the server in DMZs which are not present in the locations where we need EDGE functionality.

Given the fact we are utilizing public cloud, we can think of a setup where edge can be contacted inbound from allowed Ips of JPD/s we are hosting at the same cloud provider.

I am missing some details from your arch to start thinking of it. Pls call me to 0547887077 for few tech questions about the edge. To understand if self-hosted  edge with SaaS Jfrog is feasible at all in our case.

Subject: [#183994] Fwd: Following our commercial discussion
Hi Natan,

Thank you for your patient.

Please allow me to share with you that we have enabled a circle of trust to the following instances in order to be able to set federated repositories:



Mothership instance: laasazwestusb

Mothership Cloud Provider: Microsoft Azure

https://laasazwestusb.jfrog.io

Server Version: 7.27.6

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mothership instance: laaseucentralb

Mothership Cloud Provider: Amazon

https://laaseucentralb.jfrog.io

Server Version: 7.27.6

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mothership instance: laasazjspsing

Mothership Cloud Provider: Microsoft Azure

https://laasazjspsing.jfrog.io

Server Version 7.27.6
Please configure federated repositories and let us know whether you are able to do it successfully.

As for step 2, in order for us to set a circle of trust between the on-prem edge nodes to the SaaS instance, the edge node should be public and accessible, meaning the SaaS instance should have the ability to reach the edge nodes and vise versa. Please share with us whether this is will be possible on your side, and if it does, you should share the following with us:
The on-prem edge nodes public certificates. Then, we will update the instance root certificates on the cloud server.
The service's root certificate can be pulled in the following ways:

  1.  Under "$JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/access/keys/root.crt" (requires physical access to the server).
  2.  Alternatively, by calling Get Root Certificate REST API<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-GetRootCertificate>.
To pass the information to us using a secured method, you may follow this KB<https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/transferring-my-sensitive-content-to-jfrog-using-public-key-encryption/>.

Looking forward to your reply.

Such issues can arise if a bad key is used during decryption.. Not trying again]

This error occurs because the exported files are encrypted with artifactory.key and there was a mismatch with the artifactory.key on the destination.

In order to solve this issue, I suggest the following procedure: disable the encryption on the source instance. Therefore please follow these steps in order to perform the import/export:

Deactivate the encryption on the source instance
Export the Artifactory instance
Perform the import  on the new instance
Reactivate encryption on the source instance

Additionally, please connect the target instance to an empty DB (make sure it's truncated) prior to performing the import.

Please perform the export/import following the above steps and update me on the status.

Shai Ben-Zvi

Thank you for your response and patience.
I see that the url used to access Artifactory is:

https://artifactory-test.tcsbank.ru

Some sort of a Reverse-proxy or DNS has this entry noted under it.
Also its https, did you configure https under tomcat ? if not where is the SSL termination being done?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hello Amith,

I have parsed through the logs files shared and reviewed for any failure notices for the packages provided as samples. I was able to notice a 200 against all the packages in the log files. Please find below loggers for your reference.

Based on my observation, I couldn’t observe any failure entries for the above packages. I have verified for both 28th and 29th artifactory.log files. I would like to check the build logs during the iteration for any suspicious entries, could you please help with build/deployment logs from the 29th of September along with the approximate timeframe/timezone of the build published.

a user is complaining about the Set Me Up function is not working as expected for his Maven repo.--> If I'm following it as an admin and if I grant admin access to him it's working
This is what he is doing:Artifacts --> select the repo --> click on "Set Me Up" --> Enter the user's pw (and press enter) --> Now the "Generate Settings" button is greyed out while mousing over it.
Thanks and BRStephan

Thank you for your update.
Kindly note that the Xray initial database sync is resource-intensive and requires a sufficient amount of storage for the updates to be downloaded and processed. If Xray and its database are on the same machine, we recommend allocating a minimum of 500GB, with SSD, 3000 IOPS. If Xray and the database are on separate servers, Xray should have at least 200GB available, and the database should have at least 300GB available. These minimum requirements refer to a single node Xray setup. Please refer to the Xray system requirements page to review the additional needed minimum requirements.
I hope you will find this information useful.

The issue that you are facing specifically with nuget packages doesn't seem
to be a scaling issue. So I did not want to provide any recommendations
before we got to the root of the problem.
Nir was working with R&D on the bug. So I will check with him today to see
if we have more info and we can proceed from there.

Thanks,
Shubha

I'm working on this use case with R&D, as per my understanding the old uses (which have been migrated from 6. x to 7. x) is working as expected and new users(created in v7.x) are having trouble logging/accessing Artifactopry. Please advise if my understanding is correct.

Also, Could you please advise your availability for Wednesday/Thursday to schedule a meeting on our mutual availability.

There was no failure found in the artifactory-access.log file, all nugets packages were downloaded successfully.

However in Primary Node, I found Read Timed Out to nuget.org once which may have caused failure as Artifactory failed to fetch the package.

Apart from that, there is nothing I found that has caused a problem with build.

I would like to check whether you are using V3 in your nuget.config file while resolving dependencies from nuget.org?

EXTERNAL EMAIL - Use caution opening attachments and links.
Hi Vivek,

Thank you for your update.

Kindly note that the Xray initial database sync is resource-intensive and requires a sufficient amount of storage for the updates to be downloaded and processed. If Xray and its database are on the same machine, we recommend allocating a minimum of 500GB, with SSD, 3000 IOPS. If Xray and the database are on separate servers, Xray should have at least 200GB available, and the database should have at least 300GB available. These minimum requirements refer to a single node Xray setup. Please refer to the Xray system requirements<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/System*Requirements__;Kw!!AMCWqqRremt4Wx4!Ehtcjj1M644hQvythIySkYSz20egY9lsdjDlDYMfyePJZiRx5TA-qbqaGg2mRA$> page to review the additional needed minimum requirements.

I hope you will find this information useful.

02s6900002PALFnAAP5006900003jaQhZAAU[#183723] Artifactory detected docker login with wrong client IPHi Tomas,

We further went through the shared logs, and found that there were many operations with both the Ip’s “10.0.122.223” and “10.0.122.223,” also login was accepted from the IP  10.0.122.223 around 14:38:51 on 19/10. Unfortunately, we do not have much evidence from the logs for the reported timings.

Example access.log snippet:

2021-10-19T14:38:51.801Z [bf6bbd16c19ee676] [ACCEPTED LOGIN]  for client : docker_user / 10.0.122.223.

We need to make sure that the Artifactory and Bamboo servers are in the same time zone. Artifactory will be in the UTC time zone, if Bamboo is in local time then we need to compare and check both the logs by converting them to the appropriate time zone.

There shouldn't be any caching issue, whenever there is a login from the particular server Access log will display the status with the IP address. Since we are unable to reproduce the behaviour, we would request you to monitor the behaviour for a couple of days and check if you are encountering any similar behaviour.

Please let us know if you have any further questions with regards to this matter, I will be glad to assist.

Looking forward to your response.

Additionally, I noticed, in the attached screenshot, that you attempted to perform 'Zapp the cache' to a folder within the directory rather than the repository directory (remote or virtual repository where the 'XEditor global' directory is located in). Therefore, please click on the repository directory and attempt to re-scan the build.

Looking for your updates.

In addition to my previous reply, there can also be a way to limit the scope of the report to specific folder within a repository.
This will not be in the advanced filters, it can be configured using an include pattern in the resources level.

When selecting the repositories for the report's scope, you have the "Include Sub Path" option. To have only 'audience-solutions' folder data, you can add it as the include path as follows:




Please test it as well and let me know if this works and satisfies the use case.

Looking forward to hear back from you.

You showed minimum requirement as 300 GB, we asked for 400 GB .
Are we indicating that we need more than 400 GB.

If Yes, we should create a request again to expand the storage ?

Hi Vivek,

Thank you for your update.

Kindly note that the Xray initial database sync is resource-intensive and requires a sufficient amount of storage for the updates to be downloaded and processed. If Xray and its database are on the same machine, we recommend allocating a minimum of 500GB, with SSD, 3000 IOPS. If Xray and the database are on separate servers, Xray should have at least 200GB available, and the database should have at least 300GB available. These minimum requirements refer to a single node Xray setup. Please refer to the Xray system requirements<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/System*Requirements__;Kw!!AMCWqqRremt4Wx4!Ehtcjj1M644hQvythIySkYSz20egY9lsdjDlDYMfyePJZiRx5TA-qbqaGg2mRA$> page to review the additional needed minimum requirements.

Hi Kenneth,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

To begin, please notice that I have split the Support Ticket in the following way:

184069 - Artifactory issue
184159 - Support Portal UI issue

Therefore, we will handle the Artifactory issue in this ticket.

I noticed that you mentioned this is your Artifactory production instance. As it’s currently down, we might want to mark the ticket as critical - please let me know if that’s indeed the case.

From past experience, it’s possible that your server patching (yum update) has upgraded the JDK to ‘1.8.0_292-8u292’, which is known < Caution-https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/artifactory-6-x-fails-to-start-after-patching-java-8/ >  to cause issues with Artifactory 6.x.

You can quickly check if that’s the use case by executing ‘java -version’ in the Artifactory VM. If the problematic version is installed, you’ll need to downgrade the JDK, as mentioned in the link above.

If your JDK version hasn’t changed during the ‘yum upgrade’, please provide me with the following information for further investigation:

1. A copy of the Artifactory log directory ($ARTIFACTORY_HOME/logs)
2. A copy of the Artifactory Access log directory ($ARTIFACTORY_HOME/access/log)
3. The output of the ‘java -version’ command

You can send me the files using the following cURL command:

$ curl -i -T {filename.ext} "Caution-https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184069/"

I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

While I am checking on this case internally, if you could help us with the steps you have followed to resolve the upgrade issues in the past, that would be of great help to review if any of the steps that were performed as a part of fixing the DB conversion issues is the root cause of the reported issue.

Thank you for the provided information.

Based on the output of the docker push, it looks like you’re running into RTFACT-17280. This occurs when the "Repository Path" is selected in the HTTP Settings page in the Artifactory UI but the instance is configured with a reverse proxy and the Subdomain method is used.

In order to solve this issue, please navigate to the HTTP Settings page and change the method to Subdomain. Afterwards, please push the image again and update me on the status.

I look forward to your update.

I request you verify with you internal network/proxy team about why a layer with size 852.40 MB took almost 4-5 minutes to download in the current environment. Please check if there is any network delays or proxy level bottlenecks to address this issue. It would be helpful, if you can share the Apache instance configuration so that I can verify the timeouts set on this layer.

Looking forward to your update.

02s6900002PALhzAAH5006900003jaV7wAAE[#183849] Xray setupHello Anton,

A brief description of the master key is as follows:
The master.key is used to securely synchronize files between cluster nodes. It is responsible for encrypting and decrypting the shared data in the database.\

Since the deployment looks fine using the default master key, I suspect that a default value of the key has been used in the initial deployment, resulting in all data being encrypted by this master key.
If this is a completely new installation that is connected to an empty DB, the simplest way to mitigate this issue is to wipe and recreate the Xray's DB (only if this is a new installation connected to an empty DB) and redeploy Xray with a new master key, please let me know if this is a feasible solution and keep me updated with your progress

02s6900002PALhuAAH5006900003YgSpRAAV[#183624] Enabling SSH for ArtifactoryHi Leelavathi,

Thank you for your patience while I was further looking into the SSH configuration issue.

I deployed an Artifactory installation using the default values.yaml file and set the artifactory.ssh.enabled to true as shown in the previous message.

artifactory:
  ssh:
    enabled: true
    internalPort: 1339
    externalPort: 1339

As well as the nginx.ssh values:

nginx:
    ssh:
      internalPort: 1339
      externalPort: 1339


Then, once I deployed Artifactory and logged in to the nginx pod and checked the nginx.conf file under the /etc/nginx directory and noticed that it was populated with the ssh settings:

bash-5.1$ cat nginx.conf
# Main Nginx configuration file
worker_processes  4;
error_log  /var/opt/jfrog/nginx/logs/error.log warn;
pid        /tmp/nginx.pid;
## SSH Server Configuration
stream {
  server {
    listen 1339;
    proxy_pass artifactory:1339;
  }
}


Are you able to see that the SSH information was successfully populated in the nginx.conf file? Can you share the first block of this file?

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Daniel Poterman

We needed to know if there's a way in Xray Ignore Rules or Xray Policy Rules in which we can stop blocking or generating violations for vulnerabilities that do not have a fix available?
This helps us in not blocking our Ci/CD flows because of Watch Violations that apply to 100s of Docker issues for Vulnerabilities that do not have a fix available.

The behavior is same now as well. But at the moment we are struggling with couple of different issues related to performance. One is with UI and another is with the unexpected cpu usage of the database server. At the moment we want to prioritize the database issue for which we are in touch with both Microsoft and jFrog. I have also discussed the same with Itamar yesterday about how to do with this ticket (Slow UI) and he suggested to keep this ticket open meanwhile we deal with the database issue.

1- Could you please elaborate on the reason why sharing the same filestore is not recommended? Is it technically not possible or due to another reason.2 - If IAM permissions are only checked at startup, and not polled frequently, could we remove the IAM role WRITE permissions after the Artifactory service is started to bypass this constraint?

02s6900002PALqDAAX5006900003jamNWAAYURGENT - unable to upload build info when working in "project" modeHi

I need urgent assistance please.
We are in the middle of a migration from one server to another and this got us stuck in the middle of the migration of a pipeline.

In the new Art 7 server the repos are grouped in to a “project”. This is a new trick for us.
The Jenkins job is failing to upload the build info into the project build-info repo. Apparently due to permissions.

Artifactory Server is:
Enterprise Plus 7.23.3 rev 72303900 Licensed to SYNAMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES ISRAEL LTD

Jenkins CloudBees Jenkins Distribution 2.277.4.3-rolling
Artifactory plugin version 3.13.2

Server log is showing:

The build info file is attached.

The user that is uploading is “argaman.gen”.
That user is a member of an AD group which is assigned an Admin role in the project.

02s6900002PALrBAAX5006900003jaQJxAAMRe: [#183718] Fwd: Configure JFrog Artifactory SSOHi Ayelet,

Thank you for joining today's meeting with me!

During our meeting, we saw a few parameters that I recommended modifying:
1. Identifier (Entity ID) - The Identifier should be similar to "Azure AD Identifier" mentioned in the 4th section "Set up artifactory". For example: https://sts.windows.net/7000bebb-3941-4379-8b48-7fcdf8e85f3e/
2. Sign on URL - This parameter should have the same value of the Artifactory URL, as follows: https://$SERVER_NAME.jfrog.io


After modifying the Azure Enterprise Application, we'll need to modify the "SAML Service Provider Name" on the Artifactory side to have the exact value of the "Identifier (Entity ID)" on the Azure AD side.

As for the group association, you will need to add the "user.groups" claim under the 2nd section "User Attributes & Claims". In my case, the group claim was configured as follows:

Afterwards, you will need to manually create the Azure groups and name them according to the Object ID of the group and grant the required permissions:

Once a SAML user that's associated with this group will login to the Artifactory instance, the SAML authentication will occur on the Azure AD side and in correspondence, it will pass the groups association of the user in the SAML XML response.
In addition to the above, you will need to add the URLs of the Groups and Emails in the Artifactory side, which can be retrieved from the "User Attributes & Claims" under Azure:


As we were discussing the SCIM feature, you may want to consider implementing it instead of the SAML SSO integration, as it will have several major advantages:
1. User/Group persistence - SAML SSO users are only persistent for the UI Session, therefore, their permissions and group associations will not be valid outside the UI session. This will not allow SAML users to authenticate against Artifactory when configuring the clients (NPM/Maven/Docker/etc) without generating an Access Token for each user.
SCIM will manage both users and groups by provisioning them and creating them on the Artifactory side. Artifactory will treat these users the same way it will for internal users, which will let the users configure their clients without encountering any permission issues.
2. Management on Azure AD - While SAML SSO requires the administrator to create the users/groups both in Artifactory and Azure AD. The SCIM feature provisioning will aggregate all the new changes, therefore, the management of your users and groups can be handled only on the Azure AD side, without tinkering with the configurations on the Artifactory side.

For more reference, you may take a look at this SCIM Wiki page.
As for configuring the Azure AD provisioning, please follow this guide from the official Microsoft documentation.

In case reconfiguring the SAML SSO parameters on both the Artifactory and Azure AD still cause an error, please click here to book a session with me go over the configuration live during our meeting.
We will need an Azure AD administrator present in this session, in order to apply all changes on the fly.

Let me know if any additional clarifications are needed.

Best regards,
David Pinhas

02s6900002PALrfAAH5006900003jaiNnAAIRe: [EXTERNAL] [#184078] Re: LDAP based authentication with user token and RBAC implementation.Hi Jfrog,

Can you please confirm if in case of LDAP + Token approach,  authentication will happen on LDAP side or in Artifactory side? Here it seems jfrog will import the users into antifactory and then treat them as local users.

Second question, it there any automated mechanism to inform user on timely intervals to rotate their token?

Thanks,
Jeet

Hi Mihir, Nanda,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

In my answer below, I will assume that you mean for authentication using a user’s API key<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/User*Profile*UserProfile-ChangingyourPersonalSettings__;KyM!!NL78yQ!i_8CA3-rhtKBZwMAEZmNtjj44NeScUZPT7OzW7xaVLGk9YrBxjDfewth9y2PUQ$> and not an access token<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Access*Tokens__;Kw!!NL78yQ!i_8CA3-rhtKBZwMAEZmNtjj44NeScUZPT7OzW7xaVLGk9YrBxjDfewssRhCyLQ$> (kindly let me know if you mean otherwise.

Authenticating LDAP users using the user’s API key is possible only if the “Auto Create Users) is enabled in the LDAP<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/LDAP__;!!NL78yQ!i_8CA3-rhtKBZwMAEZmNtjj44NeScUZPT7OzW7xaVLGk9YrBxjDfewvCVZgqZw$> settings. The API key is saved under the internal user entity in Artifactory, so the user must exist in Artifactory and not only in the LDAP server for this to work. The user also must be placed under a specific group.
Please note that API key authentication will work only for REST API/JFrog CLI calls and not for UI authentication.

I hope this helps.

02s6900002PALraAAH5006900003jaZfzAAE[#183936] Support for generating non-expiring tokensHello Todd,

Thank you for your patience while I was working on this case.

I further discussed this use case with our internal teams and would like to clarify that this is the expected behavior. When you are trying to create a non-expiry token using non-admin users, you will be able to create the token till the validity period ( by default: 3600 seconds ) and you cannot create the non-expiry access token using the non-admin users:




In case if you would like to create a non-expiry token for the non-admin users, you need to use the admin users to create the same as below.




** where --server-id=local ( JFrog CLI configured with admin user ) and --server-id=tester ( JFrog CLI configured with tester user who has only read access to Artifactory )

I hope this information addressed your query. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions, I will be happy to assist you.

Looking forward to your response.

CAUTION EXTERNAL EMAIL

Hi Shambhu,

I have been further testing.  If we keep the default value of the property, we see the _system_ user perform the cleanup and delete, but when we set it to 30 MS, the user that deployed performs the delete.  I have reproduced and reached out to R&D around this behavior.  I am also testing out a few more values for the property to see why the behavior is occurring.  I should have a further update middle of the week.

There is no correct answer to this inquiry, it may depend if there is an issue or not and on the scale.
Basically, you can always make adjustments but it is should be done per issue or scale adjustment, and currently, I do not know if this is the case.
If you see a problem in the monitoring tool during peak hours, I suggest taking thread dumps and sharing if you see anything strange activity, then we can check if an adjustment is required.

*** EXTERNAL EMAIL ***

Hello Gayan,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to the issue that you are facing, in order to debug the issue further, can you please share the below information with us -

1. What is the command that you are hitting to deploy the package to the Artifactory?

2. Is it happening all the time or is it intermittent?

3. From the logs I can see that the client version of Conan is 1.39.0. Can you please confirm if there was an upgrade to the client recently and after that, it has stopped working?

4. Are the other users facing the same issue or is it only to this user?

5. Can you please try to upload from a different client and check if you are still facing the issue?

6. From the logs I can see that you are trying to upload the packages to the "conan-local" repository. Can you please try to create a new test repository and point your client to that repository and try to upload the package to that repository and let us know if you are facing the same issue or not?

I will be waiting for your response.

Thank you for joining the session today.
We called this session in order to collect all relevant information regarding the OAuth OpenID error you encountered and the possible workaround.
As I mentioned, the workaround you are currently using by hardcoding the scope in the authentication URL as below is the proper workaround for this use case:

https://************/as/authorization.oauth2?scope=openid

In the session, we collected the OAuth OpenID provider (Ping Identity) configuration, the Artifactory OAuth configuration that works and that doesn’t work, and two HAR files - one for the working scenario and one for the non-working scenario.
Using the collected information, I created a JIRA reporting this issue, for your reference RTFACT-22877.
Please note that this JIRA is currently being reviewed and will be prioritized accordingly by our Product Team with no ETA at the moment. You may want to watch and vote for this JIRA in order to receive future updates.
Following the above, I will go ahead and resolve this ticket for now. Should you have further questions, please reply to this email to have the ticket reopened.

Also, Could you please advise your availability for Wednesday/Thursday to schedule a meeting on our mutual availability.

02s6900002PALuaAAH5006900003YeigMAARRe: [#182288] Duplicate repositories however 1 has permission issueHi Sophie,There is no reason to set Include Patterns if you are using the default all (**/*). It's more efficient to add an Include Pattern for what you want then, an Exclude Pattern for what you don't. This way your Include Pattern only allows access to what you want and in turn excludes everything else. You can see how this becomes very efficient when pulling from a repository the likes of github.com where there are thousands of projects to pull from. 
So you see my confusion, both the github-release-remote and test-github have the same Include and Exclude Patterns however, I am unable to download from github-release-remote the draw.io-15.3.8-windows-installer.exe file after adding jgraph/drawio-desktop/**/* within the Include Pattern. Although, I can download the file from test-github. 
NOTE: Things can still be downloaded from github-release-remote just not anything within the jgraph/drawio-desktop/**/* path. 
While you look into this, I'll do the following additional testing:Download something else from both repositories that exist in the cache and that doesn't. To verify artifacts can be pulled locally (cache) and externally (proxy) by both repositories.Add additional Include Patterns and attempt to download artifacts from them. To verify adding new Include Patterns are working for both repositories.

Thank you for that update, including the details about the behavior you are seeing. Moving Artifactory and Artifactory's DB to dedicated servers is a good idea.

Per your request, we'll close this case and you will create a new case if the issue persists after moving Artifactory's servers.

02s6900002PAMASAA55006900003YeM6nAAFRe: [#181908] Limitation when searching for packagesHey Daniel,

Thanks for the update. The issue re-appeared this morning and I followed your suggestion and did a tcpdump while attempting to login.

I used the “any” interface just to make sure I have all the data. As mentioned before, our Artifactory is running as a docker container in a docker network. The gateway is 192.168.14.1, the PostgresDB is 192.168.14.2 and Artifactory is running at 192.168.14.3. NGINX is running natively on the docker host to proxy requests. The same docker host is also running Jenkins.

When I filter the pcap file on HTTP protocol (see tcpdump any-failure http.png) you can see the POST (clicking the login button) and getting a 401 error 20sec later. In between there is a lot of PGSQL traffic between the DB and Artifactory.

Filtering the same file on LDAP protocol (see tcpdump any-failure ldap.png) shows no results. Indicating there was no request and obviously also no response.

After the capture I restarted the container and the login took a very long time. Looking at the PCAP the login request was made at t+10 and acknowledged t+90. (See tcpdump any-working http post.png and tcpdump any-working http 200.png). Filtering the file on LDAP it shows several successful ldap searches  (see tcpdump any-working ldap.png) so I’m not sure as to why it takes 80sec (4x 20?) before the login comes through.

Because of security I cannot provide you the pcap files.
I did not upload a new support bundle since I believe it will not show any additional info. Let me know if you disagree and I’ll upload a new zip.

Hope this information is of any use.


Met vriendelijke groet,
Kind regards,

Niels

Hi Niels,

Thank you for your patience while I was reviewing the new log files.

Going over the logs, I wasn’t able to find any new information regarding the timeout issues you encounter.

It appears that the request is being sent from Artifactory to the LDAP server but the response is not returned which is resulting with the timeout error.

As a next step I recommend tracing or pinging the connection between Artifactory and the LDAP server when the error occurs to further investigate where the connection issue may reside.

In addition, I am also trying to set up a similar environment to reproduce the error internally.

Viewing the logs you have below it says we only transferred 7.9GB but when I go into the admin view it says we had 14.45GB transfer.  Why is there a discrepancy?


cat artifactory*.log | awk -F '|' '{ sum += $7 }; END { print sum }' | numfmt --to=iec-i

7.9Gi

Thanks for the reports, Soly.

We have found that some of the data is incorrect. We have most of the docker requests going to "sdc_ci" or "sdc_staging" while that's not correct, they are actually going to "sdc_prod" or "sdc_prodeu". For example, all the ones with origin IP 52.34.234.2.

Is it possible that there's a mistake in your logs?

Thanks,
Pedro

Hi,



Yes, see the graph below.  Trying to trace down the reason the spike jump here as it’s pretty significant.  We are being invoiced for these transfers so please a prompt response is requested.



[Chart  Description automatically generated]





Also these jumps, 100GB jump for each of these is pretty substantial too.  Need to know if you have the source of these transfers, repository and examples of the artifacts being transferred.  Maybe it’s consistently the same thing.

Hi Jason,

Thank you for your patient.

Please allow me to share with you that I went over the logs of monitaur and saw 2 requests - failed with 404 and successful one.
The failed one indicates the request reached from another Artifactory and the success came from the pip client.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

According to the logs you shared, it appears that the PostgreSQL address (10.13.242.84) is unreachable from within the Xray Server container.

To troubleshoot this behavior, we’ll need to inspect the following files:

.env - this file is located in the same directory from which the docker-compose installation was made (e.g. where config.sh is). It includes an environment variable called “JF_THIRD_PARTY_BIND_IP”, which will be configured as the internal Xray address. In my case, JF_THIRD_PARTY_BIND_IP is 10.156.0.95.

System.yaml - this file exists both within the xray-server container and in the Docker volume (~/.jfrog/xray/ by default). In this file, the IP address which we previously observed being associated with “JF_THIRD_PARTY_BIND_IP” will be configured 3 times:

shared:
    node:
 ip: 10.156.0.95         id: joeyn-ubu-dmz
        name: joeyn-ubu-dmz
    jfrogUrl: http://joeyn-repro:8082
    security:
        joinKey: ***
    database:
        type: postgresql
        driver: org.postgresql.Driver
        password: 123456
 url: postgres://10.156.0.95:5432/xraydb?sslmode=disable     rabbitMq:
        password: ***
 url: amqp://10.156.0.95:5672/ router:
    entrypoints:
        externalPort: 8082


As you can see, the node IP, PostgreSQL address and RabbitMQ address are all set to the same IP.

Using the above information, could you take a look at your .env and system.yaml files and let me know if the same logic is implemented?

Best regards,
Joey Naor

Hello Ricardo,

You have the correct understanding!

Your system will scale based on the CPU/Memory usage of your Artifactory instance. If you would like to run a load test on your instance, you can. However, please let us know before you do this in order for us to monitor your instance.

Hi,


So you mean to say that our instance scales indefinitely?

Are we allowed to run a load test on our own instance and it's API?

We need to have numbers to get an idea how far we can scale.

We are not using SumoLogic so that doesn't solve log access for us.


Regards,


Ricardo.

Looking at the REST API : https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-BuildUpload
Its specifying:
Usage: PUT /api/build?project=<project> -H "Content-Type: application/json" --upload-file build.json

Where do I specify the project in the Jenkins config?
How is Jenkins supposed to know the project??

Thanks
Amit

02s6900002PAMJjAAP5006900003jaclDAAQ[#183987] Artifactory Binaries Store DirectoryHello Leo,

Please note that if the value of the fileStoreDir element begins with a forward-slash ("/') this value is considered the fully qualified path to the filestore folder, since your intention is to store the binaries in the /mnt/ha-data directory please remove the forward-slash prefix, as follows:

<config version="v1">
    <chain template="file-system"/>
    <provider id="file-system" type="file-system">
        <baseDataDir>/mnt</baseDataDir>
        <fileStoreDir>ha-data</fileStoreDir>  
        <tempDir>/temp</tempDir>
    </provider>
</config>


However, once the binarystore.xml file is updated with the new configuration, all existing binaries will remain in their original location, thus, to move the existing binaries I assume you'll need to schedule a maintenance window, since stopping of Artifactory service is required.
The procedure is as follows:

Stop Artifactory
Copy/rsync the current baseDataDir directory to the new location
Change the binarystore.xml configuration
Start Artifactory

Please be noted that as a precaution and to avoid unforeseen edge cases, I strongly advise backing up the filestore and testing the aforementioned operation in a non-production environment.

Thanks for replying.  Apologies for conflicting the NU1102 case with our stability case.  Do you have an ETA on recommendations on the stability case?  Recommendations for hardware, configuration, upgrade, etc..  Our meeting a several weeks ago was left open ended with action items on the JFrog side, so we are awaiting further recommendations.

Thanks,

Hi Nate,

The issue that you are facing specifically with nuget packages doesn't seem to be a scaling issue. So I did not want to provide any recommendations before we got to the root of the problem.
Nir was working with R&D on the bug. So I will check with him today to see if we have more info and we can proceed from there.

Thanks,
Shubha

Subject: RE: [#175885] Artifactory down after upgrading to 7.19.8

Naveen,

Can you send Nir the information he requested?

Nick,

From my understanding of the meeting the Artifactory architects (Shubha to connect internally at JFrog) were going to look at the big picture and make a comprehensive list of suggestions instead of try this then that.  Nir suggested trying one thing, but then Shubha did not agree.  I am expecting more direction from Shubha based on the information she gained during the meeting.  For example, hardware recommendations, upgrades, rebuilding servers, etc…  Please follow-up with the architects to provide a path forward, we’ve been dealing with this for over 2 months and its operationally burdensome and creates a high level of risk for the teams who depend on our platform.


Thanks,

The only other piece here that might be affecting it is the fact that we are running Artifactory on Docker, although we were able to exec to the container and verify to connectivity to both the helm.datadoghq.com and github.com domains.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#184080] Helm Repo
Hi Todd,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

Since the index.yaml file and the actual charts are located in different hosts/path the configuration of the Helm remote repository needs to be as follows:

The repository URL should point to the root path where the index.yaml is found - "https://helm.datadoghq.com<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/RT8uCDkrmYiQkoZ1IWBEsC?domain=helm.datadoghq.com>"
The  "Chart Base URL" should point to the path where the charts are stored - "https://github.com/DataDog/helm-charts/releases/download/<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/lGFGCERvnZtKNljmuwX_b-?domain=github.com>"

I tested on my end and verified that I was able to proxy the Datadog Helm repo and the charts are cached in Artifactory.
Please find below screenshot of the remote repository configuration I used:

[helm_datadog]


Make sure to aggregate the remote repository in a virtual repo (in order to properly resolve charts, virtual repository is required) and to update the client (helm repo update) before trying to resolve the charts.

Let me know if the above configuration works on your end, I look forward to your update.

Hello Ricardo,

You have the correct understanding!

Your system will scale based on the CPU/Memory usage of your Artifactory instance. If you would like to run a load test on your instance, you can. However, please let us know before you do this in order for us to monitor your instance.

Hi,



So you mean to say that our instance scales indefinitely?

Are we allowed to run a load test on our own instance and it's API?

We need to have numbers to get an idea how far we can scale.

We are not using SumoLogic so that doesn't solve log access for us.

Ricardo.

Subject: [#183990] Need only 443 port for JFrog NLB


[**EXTERNAL EMAIL**]
Hi Prajwal,

Thank you for joining the session with us today.
Over the session, you explained to us by default the NLB is using both 80 and 443 ports as a listener. Due to security reasons, you have to use only 443 port and as suggested, you have disabled port 80 at the load balancer level by updating the active listeners on the NLB by removing port 80 on the load balancer configuration. We reproduced the issue by hitting the load balancer URL where the URL failed to forward the request to Artifactory.  We modified the values.yaml config file to have the https backend traffic and we made sure to have the https port enabled then performed the helm upgrade and still the issue persisted. As a test, we enabled the http port by updating the values.yaml and when we hit the the LB URL, the request forwarded to Artifactory as expected.
https://github.com/jfrog/charts/blob/master/stable/artifactory-ha/values.yaml#L1916

As discussed in the session, we will further check with our internal team on the reported issue and we will keep you posted with findings.

I must admit I’m a bit disappointed by this. We need better insight in the logs and performance metrics to support our teams.

Hello Ricardo,

You have the correct understanding!

Your system will scale based on the CPU/Memory usage of your Artifactory instance. If you would like to run a load test on your instance, you can. However, please let us know before you do this in order for us to monitor your instance.

Hi,



So you mean to say that our instance scales indefinitely?

Are we allowed to run a load test on our own instance and it's API?

We need to have numbers to get an idea how far we can scale.

We are not using SumoLogic so that doesn't solve log access for us.

Ricardo.

Sure thing. Just as a note, I repeated the steps below per attempting to change the password of the admin user in mongodb container and it did not work. The outcome is that the command is stuck hanging in the shell after entering the command in step 4 you’ve provided. Here are the responses to some of your inquiry questions below. Thank you:

1. I am getting an odd behavior where, I have a cached xray path available in the browser history ending with “?type=sso&token=<the token>”. If I access that historical link in my browser, I am able to quickly at the top right select “log in”. When I do so, I am able to login to this session with the default admin/password. Then, I am able to access the other xray menus like an admin would (except everything seems weirdly slow and doesn’t work like unable to generate support logs). However, if I just access our xray instance in the browser without that token path, I get the redirection to login through artifactory authentication provider instead, in which case suddenly the exact same default admin/password does not work. I really need to access xray as an admin user but I can’t seem to do so, even with an Artifactory-created admin user.

2. So, per #1 above, there is an SSO option that appears when I access the regular xray path without the token appended to the link. In this case, sso login is an option, but when I sign on with my company’s smart card/sso, that user is no able to access xray as an admin. Is there a way to access xray as an admin user other than the default admin user? I have a couple internal users set up in artifactory that I’ve set to admin, but cannot seem to access xray as an admin.

3.

  *   It is definitely experiencing it on the admin user on local cached session.
  *   I’m not sure how I figured this out, but like #1 above, only when I access the saved/cached url with the token in it, and then quickly at the top right click “log in”, can I access the default admin/password user. When I do click “log in” and attempt to log in with an artifactory user, for instance, I am not sure if the buggy behavior exists, per below bullet point of not being able to do anything due to permission level.
  *   As a non-admin user on a non-cached (new) session, I am not really able to do anything at all in the xray UI due to not having the correct permission level. So it’s hard to tell if the bugginess is still intact.

Subject: [External] [#181374] Please advise - Xray admin user login troubleshooting - Thanks

Hi Tyler,

Thank you for the information, I have received the logs.

In order to clarify a few more points, please answer the following:

  1.  Could you clarify what you are referring to when you mentioned “local cached session” and “authentication redirects via artifactory, the admin password combination no longer works”?
  2.  Are you using SAML Authentication for Xray admin?
  3.  Regarding the buggy/spinning UI, are you experiencing this on the
     *   Admin user on local cached session?
     *   Non-admin user on local cached session?
     *   Non-admin user on non-local cached session?

Also, please try performing the below docker commands to reset the Xray admin password one more time:
1. Connect to MongoDB container



docker exec -it <container ID> bash



2. Connect to MongoDB



mongo -u xray --authenticationDatabase xray --authenticationMechanism SCRAM-SHA-1 -p password

* The default password is “password”
* If not “password”, the default password could be stored in MongoDB_Admin_pass.txt either in the /root directory or in the user's home folder


3. Switch to Xray DB



use xray


4. Change admin password



db.getCollection('users').update({name: "admin"},{$set: {password:"qCjYNYARDMbIOcYf6fAJYEI04vAeeJjSy/WIfNv1LV0="}});


5. In the UI, type in
User: admin
Password: password


Please let me know if resetting the Xray admin password using the above commands worked for you.
If the above solution does not work, we can go ahead and schedule a session for the issue.

Hi Michael/Sam,

Thank you for your response.
I have tested a similar upgrade path and I confirm that the 'anonymous' access is not impacted as a part of the upgrade.

With regards to your other query on the node_events table issue, I would like to update you that the issue is not reproducible with an attempt of the upgrade at our lab. We would like to expedite the discussion by meeting you over a web session for 30 minutes and hence request you to share with us your multiple available time slots for today and the time zone as well. During this meeting, we will discuss the current issues after the upgrade towards the suggested fixed version of the Artifactory instance to prioritise the next steps.

02s6900002PAMTKAA55006900003jahMPAAYRE: [EXTERNAL] [#184057] Content browsing / mime typeThe use case is users hosting static websites from artifactory. The repo as such is a folder of html and other website stuff (js, svg, png, css).

Before this update, the link I provided would load the index.html page in the browser. Links in the html, to other pages/folders in the directory, would work as expected (clicking them loads them in the browser). Content Browsing was NOT enabled on the repo.

Today, every html page triggers a download. When I enabled content browsing based on the earlier message it DID make that first link work- the index.html file loaded correctly. However, the image files do not load (despite the browser reporting a 200 on the load). The links that lead to a folder that contains an index.py do not  load- they open up the artifact browser. A different page that has links to actual html files has nothing at all happen when clicking the links.

I need to figure out how to get the old behavior back. Preferably just loading the files directly. This is a serious issue for us- please let me know if we can schedule a call to figure this out.

Hi Paul,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

My name is Andrey and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

With regards to the reported behavior, kindly note that it is required to set the "Allow Content Browsing" to view content such as HTML or Javadoc files directly from Artifactory.

Please clarify which links/files are not loading following the change in the repository setting.
Once the "Allow Content Browsing" is enabled, it is possible to view the content of HTML files by clicking on the "URL to file" link or on the file in the native browser.

Looking forward to your update.

I was able to test the two APIs GetVulnerabilitiesReportContent and GenerateVulnerabilitiesReport. Please find the document attached with the testing results. I was able to do it without using the project feature itself. I tested it on the same version of Artifactory and XRay as yours.

I am currently checking your query about https://artifactory.unit.voya.net/xray/api/v1/summary/build?build_name={buildName}&build_number={buildNumber}
I will keep you posted about it.

Please let me know if you have any questions with regard to the first two APIs.

Hello Patrice,

Thank you for allowing me some time.

I have parsed through the shared information and am unable to conclude the cause of the issue.In order to expedite the issue I believe a screen sharing session would be helpful. Could you please share your multiple available time slots along with the timezone to schedule a session based on mutual availability.

I looked through the install instructions but I am still confused on which installation option I should choose. I would prefer to install myself without a unix engineer but it is hard to tell from the instructions if this will work with the account and permissions I have been given.
Is it possible to setup a quick meeting this week to walk through the options and give me some recommendations on how I should proceed?

Thanks for that suggestion. I had already increased those limits to 100K and it didn't really help, at least not with the crashes. I have been monitoring this since the 20th when I removed the plugin. The system is now stable with cpu and memory usage and has not restarted.

[A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence]


We have a ticket open with Whitesource now to try and debug the plugin. I think we can safely close out our ticket with you based on the stability over the last week. I want to add how much our team appreciates your help identifying this issue. Thanks to you and Jfrog for going above and beyond to help us.

Thanks,
David

[CAUTION: This Email is from outside the Organization. Unless you trust the sender, Don’t click links or open attachments as it may be a Phishing email, which can steal your Information and compromise your Computer.]
Hi David,

Until you get help with WhiteSource, I would like to kindly request to check if the following can also help:
We can try to increase the number of max open files or processes in /etc/security/limits.conf, and restart the

application. For example:

*               hard    nofile          65535
*               soft    nofile          65535
*               hard    nproc          unlimited
*               soft    nproc         unlimited
(It might require a higher value, the above is just an example).
I am not sure if this may help, but in case the plugin requires us to open a lot of files, we also need to make sure we are not limited by the OS.
This usually can help with OOM issues.
Not sure if it will solve our problem, but still worth trying.

Subject: Re: [External] [#181374] Please advise - Xray admin user login troubleshooting - Thanks

DaYoun,
Sure thing. Just as a note, I repeated the steps below per attempting to change the password of the admin user in mongodb container and it did not work. The outcome is that the command is stuck hanging in the shell after entering the command in step 4 you’ve provided. Here are the responses to some of your inquiry questions below. Thank you:

1. I am getting an odd behavior where, I have a cached xray path available in the browser history ending with “?type=sso&token=<the token>”. If I access that historical link in my browser, I am able to quickly at the top right select “log in”. When I do so, I am able to login to this session with the default admin/password. Then, I am able to access the other xray menus like an admin would (except everything seems weirdly slow and doesn’t work like unable to generate support logs). However, if I just access our xray instance in the browser without that token path, I get the redirection to login through artifactory authentication provider instead, in which case suddenly the exact same default admin/password does not work. I really need to access xray as an admin user but I can’t seem to do so, even with an Artifactory-created admin user.

2. So, per #1 above, there is an SSO option that appears when I access the regular xray path without the token appended to the link. In this case, sso login is an option, but when I sign on with my company’s smart card/sso, that user is no able to access xray as an admin. Is there a way to access xray as an admin user other than the default admin user? I have a couple internal users set up in artifactory that I’ve set to admin, but cannot seem to access xray as an admin.

3.

  *   It is definitely experiencing it on the admin user on local cached session.
  *   I’m not sure how I figured this out, but like #1 above, only when I access the saved/cached url with the token in it, and then quickly at the top right click “log in”, can I access the default admin/password user. When I do click “log in” and attempt to log in with an artifactory user, for instance, I am not sure if the buggy behavior exists, per below bullet point of not being able to do anything due to permission level.
  *   As a non-admin user on a non-cached (new) session, I am not really able to do anything at all in the xray UI due to not having the correct permission level. So it’s hard to tell if the bugginess is still intact.

Subject: [External] [#181374] Please advise - Xray admin user login troubleshooting - Thanks

Hi Tyler,

Thank you for the information, I have received the logs.

In order to clarify a few more points, please answer the following:

  1.  Could you clarify what you are referring to when you mentioned “local cached session” and “authentication redirects via artifactory, the admin password combination no longer works”?
  2.  Are you using SAML Authentication for Xray admin?
  3.  Regarding the buggy/spinning UI, are you experiencing this on the
     *   Admin user on local cached session?
     *   Non-admin user on local cached session?
     *   Non-admin user on non-local cached session?

Also, please try performing the below docker commands to reset the Xray admin password one more time:
1. Connect to MongoDB container



docker exec -it <container ID> bash



2. Connect to MongoDB



mongo -u xray --authenticationDatabase xray --authenticationMechanism SCRAM-SHA-1 -p password

* The default password is “password”
* If not “password”, the default password could be stored in MongoDB_Admin_pass.txt either in the /root directory or in the user's home folder


3. Switch to Xray DB



use xray


4. Change admin password



db.getCollection('users').update({name: "admin"},{$set: {password:"qCjYNYARDMbIOcYf6fAJYEI04vAeeJjSy/WIfNv1LV0="}});


5. In the UI, type in
User: admin
Password: password


Please let me know if resetting the Xray admin password using the above commands worked for you.
If the above solution does not work, we can go ahead and schedule a session for the issue.

02s6900002PAMZ8AAP5006900003jaUx8AAERe: [#183836] GoLang repositoriesHi, thanks for reaching out. We are still having issues, but have at least
narrowed down the problem to be reproducible, within our environment.

We have an issue where we set the GOPROXY to point to our virtual
repository named "stash-core-go" and have no value (unset) GOPRIVATE.

The steps to reproduce are

unset GOPRIVATE
export GOPROXY="
https://stash-core-local-dev:TOKEN@stash.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/go/stash-core-go
"
rm go.sum
go clean -modcache
# edit go.mod: remove everything but module & go 1.16
go mod tidy


The above forces a re-downloading of dependencies. This results in 404
errors trying to access our own (stash-core) modules. For example:

github.com/stash-core/database-tools/pkg/transaction: cannot find module
providing package github.com/stash-core/database-tools/pkg/transaction:
module github.com/stash-core/database-tools/pkg/transaction: reading
https://stash-core-local-dev:xxxxx@stash.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/go/stash-core-go/github.com/stash-core/database-tools/pkg/transaction/@v/list:
404 Not Found


"stash-core" is private, so you won't be able to see it, however this path
does exist:
https://github.com/stash-core/database-tools/tree/main/pkg/transaction and
the "stash-core-github-remote" Repository in Artifactory is configured with
a username/token that has access to the repository.

The current workaround is to set GOPRIVATE to "github.com/stash-core", but
this defeats the purpose of using Artifactory. We'd like all downloads to
go through Artifactory.

Appreciate any insight you can provide.

02s6900002PAMdUAAX5006900003jamNWAAY[#184180] URGENT - unable to upload build info when working in "project" modeHi Amit,

Thank you for the logs.

I missed your last email before I asked for the Support Bundle.

Regarding the use of Projects within the Jenkins Plugin, currently there’s no ETA on when this functionality will be implemented. Therefore, if you would like to continue to use the Jenkins plugin, the way to implement this now with Projects is via the following steps:

Publish the build normally to artifactory-build-info (the default repository where all build info has been stored until now).
Use the API to retrieve this build information and publish it to the appropriate project’s build info
Delete the existing build info JSON in artifactory-build-info

For clarity, artifactory-build-info is the default repository where all build information is published when a Project isn't specified. If a build is published to a Project, the build-info will be located in a repository with the following name: <project-key>-build-info.

Alternatively, you can restructure the pipeline to use the JFrog CLI or API which both support the Project option.

I hope this clarifies.

Best regards,
Sam Rosenstein

02s6900002PAMeXAAX5006900003jaeNRAAYRE: [#184009] Artifactory not starting up - config error in logsHi Ino,

Thank you for the answer. I asked my team if anyone has made any changes to the Config Descriptor via the UI but I doubt that's the case as that's not usually our practice. What are other possible causes of this issue?

Please note that I didn't simply rename the "artifactory.config.latest.xml" file. That file also had invalid config. I had to manually edit the config before naming it "artifactory.config.import.xml". I only knew the correct value to add because I contacted a colleague who knew what it was supposed to be. When the config descriptor gets corrupted does the "artifactory.config.latest.xml" file usually contain a correct version? Is it unusual that in this case it was corrupted too?

Thanks,

Maria

Subject: [#184009] Artifactory not starting up - config error in logs

Hi Maria,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
From the error messages and the steps you have taken to restore Artifactory, it does look like the <repoKey> missing in the config descriptor has caused an issue.
It's hard to determine why the "repoKey" was removed, but the possibility is that it was removed from the UI under the Admin module - Advanced | Config Descriptor page.
In case of a corrupted config descriptor issue, the best way would be to restore the previous working config descriptor, which you have followed to change the name of the "artifactory.config.latest.xml" file to "artifactory.config.import.xml" file and restart Artifactory. (https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuration+Files)

The recommended way to prevent it from happening again would be to keep a backup of Artifactory<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Backups>.

I hope this answers your question. Please let me know if you have further questions about this case and I will be glad to assist you.

We are still getting the same error after modifying the URL. I am wondering if I need to add a specific line to copyOnEveryStartup for this to overwrite the old URL in the DB perhaps?

As you can see from the output of kubectl, this is still blocking the install:

$ kubectl get pods -n artifactory

Confirmed that all of the empty xray indexes were 0/0 this morning.
For a single repo I initiated the the copy from the non-xray'd local repo to the xray repo.
In vSphere performance monitoring I can see that the CPU gets pegged at 100% for awhile, however the XRAY server is currently configured for 16cpu x 32GB RAM and I'm wondering what it should potentially be scaled to.
Looks like the logs are indicating that the indexing of this small portion of the data of interest is failing. When this specific index completes, I will compile a log bundle for JFROG to review, as this seems to be a recurring issue that we need assistance to resolve.

Hi Jason,

Thank you for your patient.

Please allow me to share with you that I went over the logs of monitaur and saw 2 requests - failed with 404 and successful one.
The failed one indicates the request reached from another Artifactory and the success came from the pip client.

Hello Venkat,

Thank you for the information.

Hi Jon,

Thank you for sharing the files with me.

It appears that you are trying to add two additional shards to your already existing storage environment. If this is the case it should be possible to add these two shards.

Regarding the email, unfortunately it is not possible to not receive the zip file as you are part of the correspondence.

I hope you find this information helpful.

Thank you for your patience.

I wanted to let you know that during the past few days, we had several internal meetings about this internal item (XRAY-8622).
Currently, it's being investigated and tested by R&D and Product to conclude a final action plan and ETA.

Once the item will be concluded, it will be part of the roadmap.
I will keep this ticket open until I have the ETA which is most likely during the coming days.

02s6900002PAMkpAAH5006900003Yg1b1AAB[#183057] Error when using Artifactory as Docker Registry with podman pushHi Michael,
Thank you for the detailed response.
I have tried to reproduce this behavior using podman in order to push images to Artifactory in our lab environment, however, similar to what you have mentioned during the conversion in this thread, it worked as expected and didn’t encounter any issue pushing images to Artifactory using podaman.
Furthermore, it was mentioned that two users who experienced difficulties in this regard worked with a specific setup/environment for the client on their end.
Could you kindly elaborate how podman is being used on their end where this behavior reproduced?
For example, on which OS the client is installed and running?
What type of authentication (API-Key/Token/user-password) is being used to $podman login to Artifactory and if for any type of authentication this behavior persists?
In addition, for better tracking in the provided logs, what are the usernames being used when this behavior occurs?
If possible, can they try to use a Docker client instead of podman to push an image to have better understanding if this behavior might be related to the client or Artifactory?
Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Kfir Avraham

Yes, we have a configured reverse proxy, but for testing purposes I didn’t use it.

Anyway just wanted to inform you that we switched to running Artifactory in docker, and updated our installation to 7.27.6, and now the problem is gone.
Please close this ticket.

I see that the url used to access Artifactory is:

https://artifactory-test.tcsbank.ru

Some sort of a Reverse-proxy or DNS has this entry noted under it.
Also its https, did you configure https under tomcat ? if not where is the SSL termination being done?

As a next step, we need to concentrate on the following steps.

1. Please let us know the exact steps you have followed to install the Artifactory. Did you use Debian installation or Linux archive installation? Please clarify, if possible share the complete set of commands used in your lower environment to install the Artifactory. The reason I am asking this question is because we were able to list 9010 port when we start the Artifacfactory manually and the issue is observed only when we do Service startup.

2. When you start the service (systemctl start artifactory.service) we execute the following script:

/opt/jfrog/artifactory/app/bin/artifactoryManage.sh start

We need to investigate what's the difference between artifactoryManage.sh start and artifactory.sh start in terms of loading JAVA OPTS.

Looking forward to your response.

I think there is something beyond the repo configuration that is wrong, since this error occurs for both the datadog repository as well as the bitnami repository (which does not require setting any value for the "Chart Base URL").

Hey Oron, thanks for the prompt reply! Testing the below configuration does not work on our end. The test button returns a `404 Not Found`. The index.yaml file is not being populated in Artifactory after configuring.

The only other piece here that might be affecting it is the fact that we are running Artifactory on Docker, although we were able to exec to the container and verify to connectivity to both the helm.datadoghq.com and github.com domains.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#184080] Helm Repo
Hi Todd,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

Since the index.yaml file and the actual charts are located in different hosts/path the configuration of the Helm remote repository needs to be as follows:

The repository URL should point to the root path where the index.yaml is found - "https://helm.datadoghq.com<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/RT8uCDkrmYiQkoZ1IWBEsC?domain=helm.datadoghq.com>"
The  "Chart Base URL" should point to the path where the charts are stored - "https://github.com/DataDog/helm-charts/releases/download/<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/lGFGCERvnZtKNljmuwX_b-?domain=github.com>"

I tested on my end and verified that I was able to proxy the Datadog Helm repo and the charts are cached in Artifactory.
Please find below screenshot of the remote repository configuration I used:

[helm_datadog]


Make sure to aggregate the remote repository in a virtual repo (in order to properly resolve charts, virtual repository is required) and to update the client (helm repo update) before trying to resolve the charts.

Let me know if the above configuration works on your end, I look forward to your update.

02s6900002PAMuBAAX5006900003Yeh5eAAB[#182223] docker-push: exit status 1Hi Christian,
Thank you for your update.
I have worked on testing this behavior in my lab environment with several Artifactory versions and was able to push a docker image using the latest JFrog CLI version (2.5.0):

root@elinaf-art-7255:/home/elinaf/jfrog-cli-2.4.1/build# ./jfrog rt docker-push 10.168.0.111:12862/dev-docker-local/hello-world:v6 dev-docker-local --server-id art727

The push refers to repository [10.168.0.111:12862/dev-docker-local/hello-world]

And also with the JFrog CLI version 2.4.1. When running the docker-pull and docker-push commands, the CLI will first attempt to login to the Docker registry. In case of a failure, the command will not be executed. I suspect that the command fails in this stage since I see this final entry is missing in the shared debug log output:

[Debug] Using access-token details in docker-login command.

And the “Login Succeeded” message is missing.
To investigate this further, I would like us to test the following:

Please run the docker-pull command using the JFrog CLI and share with me the command and output
Please add another Artifactory server to the JFrog CLI, this time by pointing to Artifactory directly and bypassing Nginx (<artifactory_host/IP>:8082) and repeat the same steps to push the image using the JFrog CLI, and share with me the commands and output
Please use the JFrog CLI docker-push command, with an extra flag --skip-login=true and share with me the command and output.

In addition, is it possible to upgrade the JFrog CLI to the current latest version (2.5.0) to see whether it persists in this version as well?
I’m looking forward to your update.

Hello George,

There shouldn't be any difference between publishing maven artifacts in 5.x vs 7.x. Can you confirm once if the settings.xml has the correct credentials from your SaaS instance? You can check that by downloading the "settings.xml" file from the "Set Me Up" in Artifactory. Also, you can redact the password and provide me with it so that  can confirm the same.

Please let me know.

Thank you for your reply.
As long as LDAP is configured, authentication with username+password/API key will be always performed first using LDAP before checking internally. The point of adding an internal user is to be able to generate an API key for the user.
With regards to your second question, API keys are not expirable, hence there is no built-in mechanism to inform users to regenerate their API key. You may implement this internally.
I hope this clarifies and addresses your inquiries.
Kindly let me know if any further assistance is needed, I will be glad to assist.

Hi Akash,

By reverse proxy logs, I mean the nginx or Apache logs depending on which of these is configured in your environment.
Can you confirm if you are using any of these in your environment? I could see from the Artifactory bundle that you are using direct configuration however would like to confirm the same with you.

Looking forward to your response.

However, when we try to download the bundle, it crashes the Artifactory service/UI. While trying to download a support bundle, I saw that RAM usage was at 8.2G, then once the download started it went up to 11.1G before I cancelled the download (we only have 12GB allocated to the server and didn't want to crash the service again). 
Our current Java settings:extraJavaOpts: "-Xms2g -Xmx8g"
Maybe we need to increase these settings again?

Hi Glenn,

It is preferred to run the cron job once a week and when the traffic is low as it involves deletion activity. You can use this link<https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cronmaker.com%2F%3F1&data=04%7C01%7Cgsalomons%40suncor.com%7Ce7c9b28c35f142ed926f08d998051b9a%7C1aa5106811a64bd286461fff31a30ffc%7C1%7C0%7C637707969971890222%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=kmK8Qy6q8NnJ9bp0KHiEb3VqEFinmbwh9fodQ09hFnA%3D&reserved=0> to generate a cron expression.

02s6900002PAMzBAAX5006900003jaixbAAARe: [#184108] JFROG Xray blocking low and medium vulnerabilitiesWatch policy execution finished at 8:18AM.
I will upload recent logs, but really looking for guidance. I haven't reviewed all of the packages to confirm that the XRAY policy was successfully applied or not. Are we missing upgrades that address performance concerns? Are there additional tuning that we should perform to insure that both Artifactory and XRAY are running optimally for our environment?

Thank you for the provided information.

Please allow me to share with you that I attempted to reproduce the described error unsuccessfully.  Kindly see the below walk-through:

Next, I created 2 Debian packages using the instructions I shared with you earlier: helloworld_1.0-1.deb and helloworld_2.0-1.deb. With the following metadata for each one of the packages -

cat helloworld_1.0-1/DEBIAN/control
Package: helloworld
Version: 1.0-1
Section: base
Priority: optional
Architecture: i386
Depends: libsomethingorrather (>= 1.2.13), anotherDependency (>= 1.2.6)
Maintainer: Your Name <you@email.com>
Description: Hello World

 small program!

cat helloworld_2.0-1/DEBIAN/control
Package: helloworld
Version: 2.0-1
Section: base

Depends: libsomethingorrather (>= 1.2.13), anotherDependency (>= 1.2.6)

Then, I pushed them to Artifactory as follows:

Following all the above, as I mentioned in my previous emails, I am suspecting the issue may be related to something blocks it on your side (the apt-get update command from the Debian client when attempting to reach your Artifactory SaaS instance)  - ie. the request is may get blocked by a VPN of the URL by string and etc. Please verify it on your side and update me accordingly.

Also, it is important to note that the Packages file with size 0 is expected behavior once the package's distribution is different than the client it was pushed from. See the below:





I hope this helps.
Please verify the above and update me accordingly.
Looking for your updates.

02s6900002PAN4aAAH5006900003YgHl9AAFRe: [#183420] Local repositories fetching does not work for Maven/GradleHey Amith,

anonymous users are not the issue, they do have access to public repositories that we defined as such.
The issue is that authenticated users don't have access via maven to private repositories, even though they have read access on those.
As described already in an earlier mail, the issue is that Artifactory does not ask for authentication on those, therefore, people fail to access local repositories, that they have read permission to.

I don't think the zoom call is necessary, as I think the issue is understood.
Are there any plans on implementing "force authentication" for maven repositories?

Best
Lars

We have a user facing script that calls this REST API: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Xray+REST+API#XrayRESTAPI-GetViolations

Before upgrading to platform, we had given users view watches/components permissions. However I don't see how to permission users to this API with read only permissions? Is there a way to allow users to view violations without giving them access to change watches? (Or is the manage watches permission read only?)

CAUTION: The message originated from an EXTERNAL SOURCE. Please use caution when opening attachments, clicking links or responding to this email.


Hi Vijaya,

Thank you for joining us on the call. We were able to troubleshoot the issue with the maven virtual repository unable to list the repository contents. On checking the errors we could see that the issue was due to trying to fetch from another bucket: fabric-artifacts. We checked and found that this belonged to the repository s3.amazonaws.com. We then removed this repository from the virtual and then we could see that the content was showing fine. We then checked the URL of this repo and could see that it was not valid and that was causing the issue

Next, we investigated another build that was failing to publish packages to the snapshots repository. We could see that it was failing due to the snapshot handling policy. We then enabled handle releases in the repository configuration and could see that the package was deployed successfully and the build also succeeded. So in general, if Handle Releases is set, Artifactory allows you to deploy release artifacts into this repository. If Handle Snapshots is set, Artifactory allows you to deploy snapshot artifacts into this repository. In our case, the Handle release was not set so that would mean that any artifact deployed to this repository should have the word SNAPSHOT in it to be considered as a snapshot artifact.

Please keep us posted on the other build failure and if you still see the issue, we will wait to hear back from you.

Best regards,

Thank you for the update, I’m glad to hear that rebuilding the OS trust resolves the issue.
With regards to a logger to enhance SSL logging in the Java level by adding the “-Djavax.net.debug=all” parameter under shared.extraJavaOpts in the system.yaml file (located under $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/var/etc/)

You may add this parameter only for debugging purposes to prevent unnecessary logging

I hope this clarifies and addresses your inquiries.
Kindly let me know if further assistance is needed, I will be glad to assist.

I have further checked internally and I would like to let you know that currently, we do not have any other option to migrate the data from one instance to another except replication and the process that I have mentioned in the earlier email.

Along with that, I would like to mention that the instance "https://ctfintechdigital.jfrog.io/" is deployed on AWS, and the instance "https://nlb.jfrog.io/" is deployed on Azure. Currently, migration is not possible without replication from one instance to another. I would request you to follow the steps that I shared with you on October 20th.

I hope that the above information is helpful to you. Please let me know if you have any queries. I will be glad to assist you.

Hi Michael,

I would first like to ask if there are any issues other than the clone taking 3hrs?

In regards to you not being able to upload the logs, I believe it is because they have the same name as the last logs that were sent to our SaaS instance. Please rename your logs and try the upload again.

Subject: RE: [External] [#182013] Artifactory Instance not able to initiate instance after Upgrade from 7.12.6 to 7.27.3

Hi Lawrence,

I was able to upgrade to version 7.27.3 after taking a Artifactory DB schema backup without any issue. But observed the below in UI, please advise.

UI Observation(s):

  *   URL and Version: Primary node URL shows with /ui and displays the frontend version 1.27.7 in the header instead of Artifactory version. Is this a new setting for 7.27.3?

Copying the system.yaml content for your reference.

Hi Babu,

Thanks for the update and glad to hear the UI is back up. The UI behavior is a bit strange. Is this consistent behavior? It's possible that one of the nodes might be still starting up or is being upgraded.

Regarding upgrading to 7.27.3, the process should be the same.

Things appear to be working now for the happy day scenario of connecting a fresh new Artifactory Version 7 AWS EC2 based instance to a newly created AWS RDS Aurora/Postgres v11.8 instance when using the AWS Cloud Formation automation for the very first time.. 
 However, I am seeing two out-of-the-ordinary, unaccounted for and not understood issues arise when I use the AWS Cloud Formation automation a second time to recreate a new AWS EC2 based Artifactory Version 7 instance to connect to an already existing AWS RDS Aurora/Postgres v11.8 instance that has been previously pre-populated with the Artifactory database objects (i.e. tables and configuration items/attributes). 
The newly instantiated AWS EC2 Artifactory Version 7 instance appears to successfully starts up the middleware and connects to the AWS RDS Aurora/Postgres v11.8 instance to retrieve the necessary configuration attributes that were previously populated. HOWEVER, NO NEW "artifactory.config.latest.xml" CONFIGURATION IS CREATED AT START UP YET THE MIDDLEWARE APPEARS TO START UP AND WORK AS FAR AS I CAN TELL. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY FROM AN ARTIFACTORY CONFIGURATION STATE PERSPECTIVE AND DATABASE MANAGMENT PERSPECTIVE.As part of our AWS Cloud Formation automation implementation, we copy the "artifactory.config.latest.xml" to file "artifactory.config.import.xml" and manipulate the "reverseProxy" XML attribute from "path" to "subDomain" to support that Docker Registry access method and place it in the /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory directory. THE "artifactory.config.latest.xml" FILE DOES SHOW UP ON OUR VERY FIRST RUN OF THE AWS CLOUD FORMATION TO CREATE THE AWS EC2 ARTIFACTORY VERSION 7 INSTANCE , HOWEVER THE "artifactory.config.import.xml" IS NOT BEING PICKED UP BY THE ALREADY RUNNING ARTIFACTORY JVM PROCESS. I HAVE TO RESTART ARTIFACTORY WITHIN THE CLOUD FORMATION AUTOMATION TO GENERATE THE NEW BOOTSTRAP FILE. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS THE CASE.
I WOULD LIKE TO SET UP ANOTHER ONLINE INTERACTIVE ZOOM TROUBLESHOOTING SESSION ASAP TO REVIEW AND UNDERSTAND THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES AND FIND POTENTIAL REMEDIES.
PLEASE ADVISE...
CheersChris Grassi

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.


First, Can you please confirm that the described behavior occurs in your on-prem instance and not in the cloud instance?


With regards to the 404 error - we can see that it is occurring to an anonymous user, can you please verify if the repository which hosted the astra-control-center-21.10.190.tar.gz.md5 artifact is allowing anonymous access?


Also, in order to set a checksum policy on a maven repo you can go to the maven setting on the repository configuration as the following:

Thank you for your response. From the support bundle and the screenshot shared, I could observe that all the nodes of the Artifactory have started successfully.

And regarding the error “jfconnect.entitlements.register config key wasn't change”,  is related to the license propagation between the nodes. Please make sure that $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/artifactory.cluster.license has a valid and a license each for all 3 nodes included in it. Meanwhile I will check more on this and get back to you

To address the Administration -> Monitoring -> Storage, the sharding-cluster displayed on the page is an expected behaviour as the cluster-file-system is achieved by the Sharding-Cluster provider.

Could you kindly confirm if the anonymous user has permission to the local-npm-repl repository? It does not, we require the user to authenticate to pull artifacts from npm-local-repl repository. Users have to be members of the read-and-write group to access this repo. The anonymous user is not a member of this group.Additionally, could you kindly share with me the content of the "Any Remote" permission content of the Anonymous user? (under Administration -> Identity and Access -> Users -> anonymous -> Repositories -> click on the "Any Remote" permission)The npm-local-repl repo is not included in the "Any Remote" permission. The only repos assigned to this permission are 3rd party registries (e.g., https://registry.npmjs.org as npm-remote). The anonymous user has access to these repos because the anonymous user is a member of the readers group. The readers group is assigned permissions to the Any Remote permission.

02s6900002PANISAA55006900003jaiGgAAIRE: [#184074] Artifactory NPM task on Azure DevOps does not work with esbuildHi Sam,

This is the JFrog-owned Azure DevOps task as documented here: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+Azure+DevOps+Extension#ArtifactoryAzureDevOpsExtension-TriggeringNpmBuilds

We're using a service connection to Artifactory with an access token.

The user is just the access token- it's scoped to a group, not a user account. I believe that would count as an internal user.

I do not understand your request for a support bundle- we have specified that the user ends up connecting to the external npmjs.org registry- so Artifactory isn't receiving traffic from the issue. To be clear- the Artifactory NPM task installs all packages except esbuild, which has this exceptional postinstall task to install another package.

Thanks,
amber

02s6900002PANIcAAP5006900003jankaAAARe: [#184206] Node crash: not responding anymore with many read timed out/broken pipes errors (2)Hello,
A node of our production cluster is not responding anymore. Logs incoming.
Restarting the service fixes the issue, but could you assist us in fixing the underlying issue?
This is probably linked to the same issue that was hapening in ticket #177762.

ADDITIONAL INFO:The node has 12 CPUs, but 'top' shows that java uses 100% of 1 CPU.The logs seem to be stuck and not written anymore.I could not generate a support bundle because the WebUI was not accessible. Instead I manually ziped the /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/logs/ directory.Regards,Jean

To further investigate this, please perform the following:

Shut down Artifactory by running “systemctl stop artifactory.service”
Run the following command and check if there are any Artifactory related processes running:

ps -ef | grep java | grep artifactory | grep tomcat

If there are any processes running, please stop them
Navigate to $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/app/bin/diagnostics, run the below command and share the output with me:

./diagnosticsUtil run diagnostics.yaml


Looking forward to your update.

Viewing the logs you have below it says we only transferred 7.9GB but when I go into the admin view it says we had 14.45GB transfer.  Why is there a discrepancy?


cat artifactory*.log | awk -F '|' '{ sum += $7 }; END { print sum }' | numfmt --to=iec-i

7.9Gi

Thanks for the reports, Soly.


We have found that some of the data is incorrect. We have most of the docker requests going to "sdc_ci" or "sdc_staging" while that's not correct, they are actually going to "sdc_prod" or "sdc_prodeu". For example, all the ones with origin IP 52.34.234.2.


Is it possible that there's a mistake in your logs?


Thanks,

Pedro

Hi,


Yes, see the graph below.  Trying to trace down the reason the spike jump here as it’s pretty significant.  We are being invoiced for these transfers so please a prompt response is requested.





Also these jumps, 100GB jump for each of these is pretty substantial too.  Need to know if you have the source of these transfers, repository and examples of the artifacts being transferred.  Maybe it’s consistently the same thing.





Thanks,

Jay

thanks for the update

Following up with the same issue of copy with another repo, this time much larger in size

Here's the sequence of copying a repo from PROD to the SaaS instance and the problem is that I'm getting less artifacts in the target than in the original source

1)The original repo in prod as reported by Artifactory UI as:
Artifact Count / Size:  3244 / 1,023.34 MB

2)When downloaded with jfrog CLI I can still see the same correct number of artifacts in the FS:

geoku@artifactory-1-vb-stage:~/ARTIFACTORY_POC/prod/libs-snapshot-local$ find . -type f |wc -l

3244

3) When uploaded with jfrog CLI to my SaaS instance I get 20 'Error' messages like ones that you identified as a bug ( so probably we can dismiss them as irrelevant for the problem at hand )

4) Here's the problem:

The target repo in SaaS instance as reported by UI after the copy:

Artifact Count / Size:
3184 / 326.19 MB

( i'm attaching the log file )

Could  you suggest?

thanks,
George

Hi George,

Thank you for waiting while I was checking on this.

Further checking internally regarding the error message in the CLI logs, we have identified it as a bug with the JFrog CLI as the CLI log shows the failure message even though the upload was successful. We created a Github issue<https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli/issues/1265> for JFrog CLI to address this behavior. We recommend you to subscribe to this Github link<https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli/issues/1265> for further notifications.

Please let me know if there are any further questions on this matter, we will be glad to assist.

Again, I appreciate your help with so many questions from us. I think we are in a much better shape now than a few weeks ago.
One last question on this ticket, we recently changed the Kubernetes resource type of Artifactory from "StatefulSet" to "Deployment".And we started seeing this in the monitoring page:When trying to click the red x for each entry, we are prompted with this:Then we clicked "Confirm", and saw this:
However, the node is not deleted. It is still there. We tried a few other nodes and they can't be deleted either.
Any ideas why? More importantly, can this be automatically cleaned up?
Thanks,

Thank you for sharing the information.
I have reviewed the logs and noticed several creations and deletions of the test_create_repo_support repository.
After the repository was deleted the GET request returned 400 as expected as the repository was not available as it was previously deleted.
Please perform the additional test in which you create a repository using only the Create Repository REST API without deleting it and share with me the name of the repository along with the updated Support Bundle from all the Artifactory nodes for further investigation.
Looking forward to your update.

Thank you for the meeting.
During the session we were not able to successfully add the edge node to the JPD.
The reason is unclear - We checked connectivity and also checked the circle of trust but we still couldn't add it and from the logs the issue was unclear.

We decided to take this offline, I will try to create a similar setup while in parallel you will upgrade Artifactory Edge to be in the same version as the main JPD.

In order to investigate this on my end I will appreciate it if you can share the following:

1. Artifactry main JPD, Edge node and MC versions.
2. Support Bundle from the main JPD, MC, and Support  Bundle from the Edge node.
3. Nginx configuration file of the Edge node.
4. The output of GET /router/api/v1/system/health output against the main JPD and the Edge.
5. During our session we saw a lot of inactive services which were not clear to me, can we try to remove them? I noticed slowness during one or two of our attempts to add the Edge node, and it is possible that all these inactive nodes may somehow impact it.

I will try to give you an update around tomorrow.

With regards to the issue reported ( Is a directory ) while performing the daily backup, as a first step, I would request you to verify that those ( .7z ) files in the mentioned directories are actual .7z files and aren't unexpectedly directories within the repository. If the files are infact .7z files and not directories, I would like for you to perform a Repository Export<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF6X/Importing*and*Exporting*ImportingandExporting-Export__;Kysj!!ACWV5N9M2RV99hQ!fw02c4-ypy0JE8VciqjkQdBHF_YCEosfziPEmIm5ufeRvJxUVfCv5-23mc8CRHRLlj4$> on the “generic-eloqua-local” repository, and confirm whether these error messages are displayed. If we do not see error messages after performing a Repository Export, please attempt a System Backup once more by manually triggering it, or allow the scheduled backup to occur once more and confirm if the error messages are gone.

In case if the issue still persists, please try renaming the sub-folders inside the repositories and let us know your observations after that. After making changes, please perform the system backup manually or wait for the next cron job to trigger the backup.

We will be looking forward to your response.

02s6900002PANQHAA55006900003jano8AAARe: [#184207] Request for help improving setup after downtime incidentHi support team,
Today morning we had an incident caused by Artifactory downtime. We run artifactory in kubernetes using the artifactory-ha helm chart, with mission control and xray next to it.
We are hoping you can review our setup, and the issues we had this morning, to help us improve our setup.
Reason for downtime: We have regular cluster patches which do node by node restarts. Today it happened that our primary & member-0 pods were on the same node and went down simultaneously. All the load then befell on member-1 (the last node). When the primary tried to restart, it could not connect to member-1 (timeouts due to the high load), which prevented it from starting up healthily.This in turn caused member-0 to not start up healthily, as it required primary to be available first.
Eventually member-1 was also killed with the patching and artifactory was down, at which point the load of multiple clusters restarting was too much for artifactory to start back up. Communication between the pods was not possible due to timeouts due to high CPU load.
When we recovered manually, we noticed that out of the two member nodes handling traffic, one was fully capped out on CPU, while the other was only using 25% of the limits.
Questions:Do you have examples for using node anti-affinity to ensure primary & member pods don't run on the same node?Why do we see such different usage between the two member nodes?Do you have more tips on the kubernetes setup, to prevent our clusters from DDoSing ourselves?We noticed the default cache_fs location goes to /var/opt/jfrog/... - which is not in the PVC, nor in an emptydir of sorts, so it ends up on the node's storage. Are you aware of this, and if so do you have workarounds to make sure the cache is stored on a PVC?When restarts happen, is there a specific order that the pods should be restarting in, or should it not matter?Finally, a recent artifactory update lists that primary node should no longer be necessary. Are there plans to update the helm chart with that new setup?
Sorry for the many questions, we would like to quickly make improvements to prevent future incidents like this, and this is high priority for us.
Thank you for your help!
Kind regards,Jeroen

02s6900002PANRyAAP5006900003jaTLeAAM[#183766] Weird url shown on the artifactory nodes cause 400 errorsHi Milly,

Thank you for joining the session with us.

During the call we further discussed the issues you were observing in the UI:

Issue 1: Upload/Download via UI is failing, using REST API both download and upload works fine.

-> Download is giving a  bad request 400 error.

-> While deploying the file, encountered a permission issue though the user is an admin.

Issue2: Observing a different version of Artifactory in UI -> Under Administration -> monitoring -> Service status.

Issue3: Strange  URL noticed under the Administration -> monitoring -> Service status.

As discussed, kindly share the below details in order to investigate the issue further.

1.  Firstly check with your network team to bypass the proxy and access the Artifactory node individually with the IP address and port. Try to upload and download the package and let us know your observations.

2. Create a video clip of the issue reproduction when the upload and download issue is encountered and share it with us, which will be helpful in showcasing the issue to our internal Team.

3.  Add the below debug logger in the system.yaml file on both the nodes (Restart is required after adding the below logger) and then reproduce the issue.

frontend:

  logging:

    application:

      level: debug

router:

  logging:

    application:

      level: debug

event:

  logging:

    application:

      level: debug

Note: I recommend removing the debug loggers post reproduction of the issue since heavy loggers would impact Artifactory performance.

4. Share the reverse proxy configuration file and the Reverse Proxy logs.

5. Share the iindividual HAR files captured during the upload and download failures.

6. Once the issue is reproduced, capture and share the Latest Artifactory support bundle with the exact timestamp of the event.

You may upload the files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the below command:

$ curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/183766/"

I look forward to your response.

We are trying to setup a Artifactory instance on IL% environment which is one of the most secured environments.  In IL5 the license can not reach out to internet, does the Enterprise Artifactory license that is provided need to reach out to Jfrog to verify license? If it does this will not work, can you provide us with a License that will not need internet to verify? We need to ensure Jfrog license works in an isolated environment and doesn't have the need to call home.

The issue is happening all the time. but only with the chrome browser. Firefox, edge and safari all work as expected. Chrome is the only browser in which this issue is occurring.
issue is happening on all repository types.
we only use LDAP users, it is occurring for any LDAP user.
the issue is only happening with chrome.

To reproduce the issue, in UI select Artifacts on left panel.select any repo, drill down to an artifact (tar.gz, wheel, etc)The general tab flashes the general tab information, then the information disappears. leaving only the ? ? on the page. In order to get the general info to display, you have to pretend to highlight the information and it now shows. see screen shots below.If I click on the info or permissions tab, they display fine, but when go back to general, the info is not displayed again. but If I double click on the general page, the information is once again displayed.

Hi Stefano,

It was a pleasure meeting with you today.

During the session, we further discussed the critical issue you're having with Artifactory, where the instance keeps hoarding connections stuck on CLOSE_WAIT and eventually freezing and being inaccessible until a restart is performed.

You have sent us some of the missing verbose Access logs from Sep. 16th, along with the latest, non verbose Artifactory & Access logs.

I have gathered all of these findings and posted them internally.

As agreed, we will thoroughly investigate the logs, consult our R&D team and get back to you as soon as possible.

Best regards,
Joey Naor

I saw your request and have booked a meeting for my soonest availability. That is in about two hours at 10:30 AM PST.

There are two problems which resulted in the five day outage we encountered: The JIRA server was upgraded while you were on a version of Artifactory released three years ago, and the emergency action we took restored functionality for the majority of users. The only remaining users impacted by this problem are Conan developers, we are meeting a documented requirement for Conan Repositories that resulted from this delay in upgrading.

I am reviewing the logs and we will most likely have to deal with the problematic package which is failing the migration. I suspect that we could remove or move the problem packages, or other wise force the migration. I will deliver my action plan to you during our next emergency call.

You can meet with me at 10:30 AM PST using these Zoom links:

We're on our way to replicating the artifacts from the lab instance to our production instance. However, I have questions regarding the curl command. If I'm understanding the curl command correctly, it's just adding the replication settings for the artifactory-build-info repo. 
How do I view the replication settings for artifactory-build-info in the UI? I want to be able to remove the replication setting once we've confirmed that the build info has been successfully transferred from the lab instance. Does the user account being passed in the curl command need to be an admin in both instances? i.e. I imagine the user account needs to be an admin to make any replication settings changes in any given Artifactory instance. Thanks,Peter

Hello Amit,

Thank you for reaching out.

I've analyzed the uploaded Xray logs, however, I could not locate any issues as it appears that all microservices are up and functioning, with that being said, could you please upload an Artifactory Support Bundle for further analysis as well.

You may upload the generated bundle using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:



curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184204/"

02s6900002PANTHAA55006900003jankaAAA[#184206] Node crash: not responding anymore with many read timed out/broken pipes errors (2)Hi Jean,

Seems like the logs are partial, they only contain the Artifactory logs, and not the Access service logs, can you please also provide them as well?
In addition, it seems you have provided logs only from on node.

Please share also a Support Bundle (you can omit the logs), so we can take a look at the server configurations.

From the last startup, I noticed you have 150 replication configured (which seems like all of them) with the same cron expression 0 0 0/6 * * ?, this is very bad if they all run at the same time, this can really make a bad impact on the performance and this might be even relevant to the issue, you must definitely change it.

Most of the time Artifactory seems to be responsive, however, I still see issues related to propagation issues between the nodes- This can also indicate on network bandwidth congestion (which could be as a result of the replications).
But to get a clearer picture, I will also need the previously requested information collected as well during the occurrence of the issue and before restarting the Artifactory.

Hello Vikas,

Thank you for getting back to me.

With this configuration, I noticed that there are two server directives, both with ssl and one on port 443 and the other port 8081.

This generally does not match the configuration Artifactory generates. Was this configuration completely copied from Artifactory or was it partially copied and edited?

Additionally, what does the command nginx -T return?

02s6900002PANXXAA55006900003Yg2dmAAB[#183105] Xray claims a build is not indexed when I can see that it isHi Ken,

Thank you for your time today.

During the session we have noticed 2 things that we suspect are related:

1. Two builds existed with name "CTM" and "ctm". The "ctm" one seemed to be deployed by mistake and we deleted it.
2. The build id (number) of some of the CTM builds contained '#'.

When we issued a forceReindex command against the builds with '#' in their id, the command failed saying that the build does not exist in Artifactory.
Other builds, which do not contain any special characters were indexed successfully.

Currently we suspect that this is due to an internal issue (for reference XRAY-7316) which was resolved in version 3.26.0.

As an upgrade of Xray to the latest version is planned soon (by EOM), we have decided the following:

1. You will instruct the users to not use any special character in the build id/number.
2. After the upgrade, you will check if any issues are still observed with regards to indexing of these builds.


I look forward to your update.

Oron Chalaf

02s6900002PANYBAA55006900003jaam1AAARe: [#183968] Re-run ReplicationHi Mohit,
To create a new replication between the repository on the old instance to the new instance, please create a replication setting, similar to the example below on the repository in the old instance. As I understand the two repositories are local repositories, you may configure replication and event-based push replication that will trigger the replication on each create/copy/move/delete immediately.
For example, refer to the relevant repository on the old instance -> replication tab -> new:
Add the URL to a repository on the new artifactory instance, enter the user and password for the new instance:
Press the test button to verify the replication configuration, once the replication is configured it will run according to the configured Cron Expression or will be triggered by the event-based action if the event base replication is enabled.
Please let me know if you were able to create the replication.
However, if you encounter any issue with the replication configuration, please share with me the full steps that were performed along with the observed errors and the Artifactory Support Bundle from both of the Artifactory servers. Additionally, you may use the following link to book a Zoom session in case further assistance is required.
Looking forward to your update.

02s6900002PANZTAA55006900003janvsAAARe: [#184213] Need help identifying if vulnerable package versions were cachedHello,
On Friday October 22nd, there was a major security vulnerability identified in npm package ua-parser-js versions 0.7.29, 0.8.0, 1.0.0. Our Artifactory proxies https://registry.npmjs.com, so we have 3rd party packages in our npm remote cache.
When I look in our npm-remote-cache, I do not see any of the compromised versions. Additionally, the versions in the cache skip from 0.7.28 to 0.7.30. I've attached a screenshot of that to the ticket.
Can we determine if any of these affected versions existed in our Artifactory at any time? We never remove things manually from our package caches unless there is a vulnerability, but I'm curious if these were removed automatically by some process. And if so, how can we identify the window that these vulnerable packages were cached on our Artifactory?
I will attach a support bundle with 5 days of logs.
Thanks,Brian

Apologies if I have misled you. Please allow me to clarify. I got the go-ahead to reopen this issue internally (as it was previously closed).

The JIRA and behavior change still needs to be reviewed by our Product and R&D team. So currently, there is no ETA. It is currently in the process of being reviewed and that may take some time. I will send you an update as soon as I hear back from them. To stay up to date I would recommend watching the JIRA as well.

02s6900002PANcmAAH5006900003jaVk0AAE[#183868] Unable to upgrade Artifactory from 7.17.11 to 7.27.6.Hi team,

Thank you for joining the call today.

Over the call we talked about the JIRA that was raised in order to handle the failing DB migrations where ‘sql_require_primary_key’ is enabled on MySQL database.
I mentioned that this JIRA was acknowledged by R&D and is pending code review.

We have performed the suggested workaround which involves these steps:
1. Shutdown the failed node service (which was tried for upgrade).
2. Create the access_db_check table with primary key as below:

CREATE TABLE access_db_check
            (
                 username      VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
                 sorting_order INT         NOT NULL,
                 PRIMARY KEY (username)
            );


3. Verified the schema status by running this SQL query:

select * from access_schema_version;

4. Updated the access_schema_version table using below query to make this migration successful.

update access_schema_version set success=1 where script='V7_25__DbCheck.sql';

5. Restart the service to proceed with remaining migrations.

Upon completing this process, we noticed that Artifactory was running successfully.
We then moved on to upgrade all the remaining nodes one by one.

Lastly, we talked about the best approach to upgrade a large HA environment, as you noticed that when the nodes are in different versions, the UI is stuck.
I recommended removing each node from the Load Balancer before upgrading it and bringing it back to the Load Balancer afterwards. You mentioned that you would rather take out 50% of the nodes, upgrade them and then bring them back to the Load Balancer and repeat the process for the remaining 50%.

Should you have any additional questions regarding what we have covered during the call, please feel free to ask. We will keep this ticket open for a few more days.

Thank you again for your time today. It has been a pleasure meeting with you.

Best regards,
Daniel Poterman

The cached images on Kubernette work because the layers are still cached.

On the other hand, we start to have many images that have the same problem on the repo many images of the repo pia-docker-production for example today at 16:35 on these two images that have been builder:
(I have attached the Azure DevOps log as a copy)

docker pull cegid-loop-docker-staging.jfrog.io/arpege-web/3.27.3/frameworkfull:4.26.0.1-20211005.6
docker pull cegid-loop-docker-staging.jfrog.io/arpege-web/3.27.4/frameworkfull:master-20211007.2


[Une image contenant texte  Description générée automatiquement][Une image contenant texte  Description générée automatiquement]


A part of the images has been rebuilt but our problem is that we are on a production instance and should not have to rebuild :(

We noticed that rebuilding the images resounds the problem for other images, I have the impression that the problematic layers are shared with other images.

Objet : [EXTERNAL] [#183922] Urgent - corrupted production image

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for the response.

I was able to observe the issue on my side as well with not being able to pull that particular tag (master-529261) of the queryhandler image.

From reviewing the image within Artifactory I noticed that the file tree was missing some of the layers listed in the manifest.json file.

Even though the layers are deduplicated to save on storage, they must be associated with the image to be able to be downloaded via Artifactory:

File listing:

[cid:image003.png@01D7CA8F.56126860]

[cid:image004.png@01D7CA8F.56126860]

However these seem to be common layers used in several other images so I was able to pull another image (emailprocessor-505742) and then queryhandler since the nonexistent layers now existed on my machine.

[cid:image005.png@01D7CA8F.56126860]

I was then able to push the image to a new repo and even though all the layers already existed on Artifactory they now showed in the file tree.

[cid:image006.png@01D7CA8F.56126860]

You'll be able to make the image pullable again by pushing the image back to Artifactory from a machine that contains all the image layers.

[cid:image007.png@01D7CA8F.56126860]

I've since removed this test repository but you should be able to follow the same steps above to redeploy the complete image.

Has this image been intermittently pullable since being deployed or did this issue just arise last week?

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with at this time.

02s6900002PANdzAAH5006900003jaigLAAQ[#184095] federated repository failing due to following errorHi Sangamesh,

Thank you for reuploading these logs. I'm sorry to say that both it and the logs submitted yesterday do not contain the debug logging that the developers need, and we will need you to recapture the error with proper debug logging.

First, It looks like Omer didn't send you the correct debug logger. The logs I see from the bundle you send this morning don't contain the "uploadLog.log" file:



I double checked the debug logger he sent, and it appears to reference the 6.X logback.xml, not the 7.X logback.xml. At the bottom of this email are the two debug logging XML snippets we need to troubleshoot this problem.

The logs sent yesterday night were reviewed by our developers, but they were unable to provide assistance because the Support Bundle system failed to capture the relevant debug logs:



We will investigate why this data capture failed after the current crisis.

For now, my understanding is that the jfrog-aws instance isn't being used as heavily. If there is any data that needs to be pushed or pulled right away, my advice is to set up temporary Push or Pull replication  with the other Artifactory. We can then solve the Federated repository problem, which looks to be a bug. As there is no evidence that this bug has been solved yet, I do not think an upgrade is needed at this time.

Please add these debug logs to the jfrog-aws instance only, then manually tar the "log" directory under /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/log folder. You only need to do this on artifactory-ha-member-0, not the primary, as it's the one receiving the bad HTTP requests from jfrog-colo.

But anyway, we are still seeing instances of this problem, but they seem to be transient and clear up after a few hours. For example, yesterday we saw it with

https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/io/netty/netty-bom/4.1.60.Final/netty-bom-4.1.60.Final.pom
https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/org/apache/cassandra/cassandra-all/3.11.5/cassandra-all-3.11.5.pom

but those were working this morning.


This afternoon (about 12:20 pm EDT) we saw it with

https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/org/apache/cassandra/cassandra-thrift/3.11.5/cassandra-thrift-3.11.5.pom
https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/org/hibernate/hibernate-validator/4.3.0.Final/hibernate-validator-4.3.0.Final.pom
https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/it/unimi/dsi/fastutil/6.5.7/fastutil-6.5.7.pom

It seems to occur when we add 1 or more new dependencies to a build but we can't make it happen deterministically. It looks like there is some chance with every new un-cached item for the pointer to the host repo to get broken by adding a trailing '/' as previously described.

We typically see it with our most commonly used virtual repo "libs-release", though the underlying problem has so far always been in our "central" maven repo. (pointing at maven central).


Can you take a look at today's logs and see if you can find anything? It looks like it is related to how the remote URL gets generated.


thanks,

This is *not* the only package where we have seen the problem.

We have seen it with

· the pom for "com.datastax.oss:java-driver-mapper-runtime:4.13.0"

o has since then started working

· the pom for "org.apache.cassandra:apache-cassandra:3.11.5"

o has since then started working

· the jar for "ch.qos.logback:logback-core:1.1.3"

o still broken

o go to https://tamr.jfrog.io/ui/native/central/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.1.3

o click on "logback-core-1.1.3.jar"

· the pom for "org.jamon:jamon-runtime:2.3.1"

o has since then started working

We don't know how to make it happen for a particular package; it just happens sometimes when we are pulling a new dependency (one that is not already cached in artifactory).



Here's how it looked for an instance of the problem, the jar for "ch.qos.logback:logback-core:1.1.3":


For us, this shows up at https://tamr.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/central%2Fch%2Fqos%2Flogback%2Flogback-core%2F1.1.3%2Flogback-core-1.1.3.jar

If you go to that page, you can see that the jar is not cached:





opening that "URL to file:" https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/central/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.1.3/logback-core-1.1.3.jar

you get:





Looking at the parent dir, you see



clicking on the pom will download it successfully

but clicking on the jar...



note that the URL in the message has a trailing slash:

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.1.3/logback-core-1.1.3.jar/



If we open that directly:



But if we remove the trailing "/" it works

Thank you for your time today.

During the session, we could see that 2 Artifactory standalone instances (Beijing & AWS) contains the same service id.
This instances exist for a few years and you are not aware of why both have duplicate IDs.
This caused an issue when trying to register one of the instances as new deployment. We have validated that this is indeed the issue by removing 'Beijing' instance from the topology and adding 'AWS'. We then, of course, were unable to add 'Beijing' instance back.

In the session, we tried to change the service id of Beijing instance so we can register it again.
We followed internal steps to change it, however this did not work and the service id was not changed.

As discussed, we will further check it internally and advise regarding our next action items.

If you encounter any issues with the previously shared commands, share with me the full REST API commands that were executed along with the full client output, in addition, please share with me the use case and the desired result.
Looking forward to your update.

Wil completed the upgrade in development.  We did not see a change in unknown licenses in development.  We ran an unknown license report after the upgrade and received the same amount of unknown violations as we did prior to the upgrade.  We scanned the watch using a custom date range of a few years and still got the same number of unknown violation when we ran the report the next day.

02s6900002PANWkAAP5006900003MmUuLAAV[#177454] Not able to push docker images to artifactoryHi Sintarose,

I wanted to start off by saying thanks for the response back to my last email. With that said, the reason why I don’t think your Production HAProxy configuration is the correct one is that there are no rewrite rules to handle the incoming docker request for docker repositories.

If you look at this example and compare it to your current Production configuration you can see that you need at least one rewrite rule to handle the versioning of the docker request:

Your HAProxy configuration :


frontend http-virtual

bind *:80

bind :::80

# Using Permanent URL

bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/certs/star.adlm.nielsen.com.pem crt /etc/haproxy/certs/star.artifactory.adlm.nielsen.com.pem

bind :::443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/certs/star.adlm.nielsen.com.pem crt /etc/haproxy/certs/star.artifactory.adlm.nielsen.com.pem


option http-server-close

option forwardfor


redirect scheme https code 301 if !{ ssl_fc }

default_backend http-pool


backend http-pool

option httpchk GET /

# Don't need stickiness if there's only one server

#  balance source

#  stick-table type ip size 250k expire 15m

#  stick on src

option redispatch

reqirep ^([^\ :]*)\ /v2(.*$) \1\ /artifactory/api/docker/docker-your-repo/v2\2 --this rewrite adds v2 to uri

reqadd X-Forwarded-Proto:\ https if { ssl_fc }

Would you please let me know your thoughts?

02s6900002PANfRAAX5006900003YfZv5AAFRe: [#182979] Artifactory-HA install fails on License importHello Ino,

I have an update. I quickly realized that I had forgotten to add "?sslmode=require" to the url which fixed the issue I posted about previously.

Now the install logs look fairly clean apart from one error which I've posted below. Now it is a bit more tricky to debug as I'm not sure which errors are relevant and which, if any, can be ignored.

As we can see, member nodes are stalled from starting:
$ kubectl get pods -n artifactory

From helm describe pod on primary pod (kubectl describe pod artifactory-ha-artifactory-ha-primary-0 -n artifactory) :

Hello Ino,

We are still getting the same error after modifying the URL. I am wondering if I need to add a specific line to copyOnEveryStartup for this to overwrite the old URL in the DB perhaps?

As you can see from the output of kubectl, this is still blocking the install:

$ kubectl get pods -n artifactory
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

artifactory-ha-artifactory-ha-primary-0   0/1     Running   0          5m22s

Thank you,
Eric

Hi Eric,

Thank you for the update.
From the configuration, I can see the URL is set to,


  url: jdbc:postgresql://opsniqcsartifactorypg.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/artifactory?user=artifactory@opsniqcsartifactorypg&password=REDACTED&sslmode=require

Can you please try removing the user name and the parameters after so it's left with,


  url: jdbc:postgresql://opsniqcsartifactorypg.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/artifactory

After making the change, please restart Artifactory and see if it helps.

  Thanks for the information. I missed to elaborate a bit more on how the users are created. We did not create the users, we just enabled LDAP access, so the users are able to login, but few users are not getting the edit profile option enabled. Our perspective is if they can login then they should be able to edit their profile by default. What is the setting we need to change for LDAP ?

  Also, based on the time you responded, I am guessing this ticket is not assigned with a resource in Pacific Time zone. Can you please make sure this ticket is assigned to a resource who is in our local time zone i.e. Pacific Time Zone so that we get faster response and we could complete the conversation in a day. I am ready to have a quick call if possible to wrap this kind of small stuff in a single call.

Hi Vijay,

After 7.3x, the ‘Edit User Profile’ option in the UI is disabled by default due to security concerns.

When adding a new user, this option should be checked in order to allow the user to edit their profile:

02s6900002PANgPAAX5006900003YgDDbAANRe: [EXTERNAL] [#183305] Artifactory Oracle Database GrowthHi,

Thanks for your response.

Option 1 and Option 2 did not work. There are no errors in the logs either to indicate what went wrong.

Option 1
I tried this on all 3 instances of the Artifactory statefulset with no luck. I checked each instance manually and I can see the plugin files were correctly placed back into the same directories I had deleted them from. I then triggered the cleanup plugin to run via the api and received a 200 response. The logs don’t show anything.

Option 2
I amended the artifactCleanup.json manually and then triggered a reload via the artifactory API. I ensured the api request went to the instance where the changes were made. I received a 200 response with the below body:
Successfully loaded:  artifactCleanup.groovy, deleteEmptyDirs.groovy

The logs showed the following:
2021-10-26T15:51:48.840Z [1;32m[jfrt ][0;39m [34m[INFO ][0;39m [9651a2e307964ec0] [o.a.a.p.GroovyRunnerImpl:263  ] [ttp-nio-8081-exec-16] - Script 'artifactCleanup.groovy' has changed. Reloading all scripts

What is noteworthy is, I would expect to see the following log entry on start up of Artifactory regarding the plugin:
https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins/blob/master/cleanup/artifactCleanup/artifactCleanup.groovy#L147
It seems as though this isn’t correctly being loaded. Is there a way to increase the log level on this plugin to get a more verbose output?

Hello Moustafa,

Thank you for allowing me some time.

In my further investigation, I was able to identify that we have a known bug titled "Issues with loading plugins using the Kubernetes secrets" tracked under internal INST-2995 with no ETA at this point.

Option 1: Possible workaround is to manually delete the files under /artifactory_bootstrap/plugins and /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/plugins directories at first and then update the secrets and perform the helm upgrade.

Option 2: Manually edit the artifactCleanup.json file in /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/plugins with latest changes and reload the plugin.
Could you please perform the above workaround and advise if you were able to trigger the plugin and advise if you were able to trigger the plugins manually.

I look forward to your feedback.

02s6900002PANgeAAH5006900003jaiWiAAI[#184088] File ShardingHi Richard,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
Regarding your questions, please see my answers below,

We currently have an Artifactory instance with 40TB of artifacts. Is there a way to distribute the artifacts through the shards to more evenly distribute the data across the shards. I can only find this is as artifacts are written.

There are 3 options you can implement with sharding "writeBehavior" settings.

roundRobin (default): Binaries are written to each mount using a round robin strategy.
freeSpace: Binaries are written to the mount with the greatest absolute volume of free space available.
percentageFreeSpace: Binaries are written to the mount with the percentage of free space available.


Our current Artifactory cluster file system has the following directories on the existing cluster: archive, ha-backup, ha-data, ha-etc. Should I point the existing cluster to ha-data/filestore?

With your filestore configuration (using ha-data and ha-backup), it seems like you're using NFS mount. You may migrate your filestore to the local filestore location following the instruction from our wiki page. If this is not the case, please share your current filestore settings (including binarystore.xml file under $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/) and how you would like to proceed with filestore settings.

Is there a performance difference using sharding vs. our existing single Artifactory cluster file system (all are mounted on a NetApp device)

Sharding presents the following benefits (ref: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Filestore+Sharding),

Unmatched stability and reliability: Thanks to redundant storage of binaries, the system can withstand any mount going down as long as M >= R.
Unlimited scalability: If the underlying storage available approaches depletion, you only need to add another mount; a process that requires no downtime of the filestore. Once the mount is up and running, the system regenerates the filestore redundancy according to configuration parameters you control.
Filestore performance optimization: Sharding Binary Provider offers several configuration parameters that allow you to optimize how binaries are read from or written to the filestore according to your specific system’s requirements.



I hope this answers your questions. Please let me know if you have further questions about this case and I will be glad to assist you.

Ino Choi

Hi Sam,
  Thanks for the information. I missed to elaborate a bit more on how the users are created. We did not create the users, we just enabled LDAP access, so the users are able to login, but few users are not getting the edit profile option enabled. Our perspective is if they can login then they should be able to edit their profile by default. What is the setting we need to change for LDAP ?

  Also, based on the time you responded, I am guessing this ticket is not assigned with a resource in Pacific Time zone. Can you please make sure this ticket is assigned to a resource who is in our local time zone i.e. Pacific Time Zone so that we get faster response and we could complete the conversation in a day. I am ready to have a quick call if possible to wrap this kind of small stuff in a single call.

Hi Sandeep,

thanks for the update

Following up with the same issue of copy with another repo, this time much larger in size

Here's the sequence of copying a repo from PROD to the SaaS instance and the problem is that I'm getting less artifacts in the target than in the original source

1)The original repo in prod as reported by Artifactory UI as:
Artifact Count / Size:  3244 / 1,023.34 MB

2)When downloaded with jfrog CLI I can still see the same correct number of artifacts in the FS:

geoku@artifactory-1-vb-stage:~/ARTIFACTORY_POC/prod/libs-snapshot-local$ find . -type f |wc -l

3244

3) When uploaded with jfrog CLI to my SaaS instance I get 20 'Error' messages like ones that you identified as a bug ( so probably we can dismiss them as irrelevant for the problem at hand )

4) Here's the problem:

The target repo in SaaS instance as reported by UI after the copy:

Artifact Count / Size:
3184 / 326.19 MB

( i'm attaching the log file )

Could  you suggest?

thanks,
George

Hi George,

Thank you for waiting while I was checking on this.

Further checking internally regarding the error message in the CLI logs, we have identified it as a bug with the JFrog CLI as the CLI log shows the failure message even though the upload was successful. We created a Github issue<https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli/issues/1265> for JFrog CLI to address this behavior. We recommend you to subscribe to this Github link<https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli/issues/1265> for further notifications.

Please let me know if there are any further questions on this matter, we will be glad to assist.

Best regards,

02s6900002PANikAAH5006900003jaiPFAAY[#184080] Helm RepoHi Team,

I observe the same 404 error when clicking on the "Test" button, however I am still able to resolve the charts successfully.
Kindly reproduce the issue and share with me the following:

1. Helm client fetch/install command that shows the response sent to the client, with '--debug' flag for verbosity when pointing to the repository.
2. Support Bundle from Artifactory, so I can see the complete logs and repository configurations.

You may upload your files using a cURL command to deploy them to our Artifactory SaaS instance:
curl -i -T {filename.ext} “https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184080/”
(no username or password required)

I look forward to your update.

I have been parsing the Xray logs and attempting to reproduce similar behavior on my end.  The Xray logs look ok and am not able to pinpoint any issues with the application.  We would like to see the Artifactory logs though around the time we see these issues.  If we have seen the same behavior recently, please send updated Xray logs and a bundle from Artifactory.  This looks to be an issue on the Artifactory side reaching this Xray endpoint.  Looking forward to hearing from you with this information.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#183508] Issues with pypi remote smart repository not indexing packages

Hello Jason,

Thank you for sharing additional information.

I can see that the monitaur-remote repository URL is configured to "https://monitaur.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pypi/monitaur-pypi-local", kindly change it to the following:

https://monitaur.jfrog.io/artifactory/monitaur-pypi-local

[smartpip1]

Next, please modify the Registry URL to be as follows:

https://monitaur.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pypi/monitaur-pypi-local

[pipsmart2]

*The Registry suffix should remain "simple"

Then, save the configuration changes and test the client behavior.

Please keep us updated if the above helped resolve the resolution issue.

I look forward to your update.

02s6900002PANjxAAH5006900003jahcIAAQRE: [#184062] Nuget request for known-missing package in local repo hangsHi Andrey,

I should have mentioned that all other repository types are working fine and the system health is fine. And even though the hang was never returning (we waited 2+ minutes), and everything else was working fine, now neither our customer or I can reproduce the issue for that local nuget repository. It just started working properly all of a sudden a few minutes after the never-ending hang. I see nothing in artifactory.log of relevance from 10:44AM on 10/26/2021 when the curl hang happened, either ☹

I’m not sure there’s anywhere to go from here.

Hi Jeff,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

My name is Andrey and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

With regards to the reported behavior, I would like to better understand the current use case, what is the desired result, what information you are seeking to receive by the mentioned curl command?

As the curl command hangs I want to verify the communication between the Artiactory and the host on which the Curl is installed, please let me know if you were able to get a response from Artifactory by running the System Health Ping<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-SystemHealthPing> REST API for example.

Looking forward to your update.

Best regards,
Andrey Granovsky

02s6900002PANk7AAH50069000035aCJnAAM[#175470] "conan install" sporacidally runs into timeout on spefic file/package/repoHello Christian,
Thank you for your response and for providing the required information.
Reviewing the below query:
SELECT relname,n_live_tup, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del, n_dead_tup, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum, last_analyze, last_autoanalyze FROM pg_stat_user_tables ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
This was running against the postgres database and not Artifactory.
Please run below command:
$ psql <databaseName> <artifactory>
For example:
$ psql artifactory artifactory
Next run the above query again.
Kindly also run the following command:
SHOW shared_buffers;
We expected to see the above in the pg_settings however the value there is not clear, also when looking at our test environment.
The above command gives a clear indication of the value used.
We are still working to reproduce the issue, however I suspect that this issue is only related to a very very large environment.
Looking at the monitoring I do see that the CPU is hitting the 100% at times, during those times do any builds fail? (the screenshots are low resolution so I might be looking at the wrong parameter, if possible send us the screenshot again as files).
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for the update.
I would like to gather more information regarding the current configuration, as I want to work or reproduction of the behavior in my lab environment.
Which Artifactory 7.19.x version was used prior to the upgrade? The current version is 7.27.6, please confirm.
Please share with me a screenshot of the repository in which the index.html and all other related files reside, if it is an option you may share with me those files.
Additionally, generate Artifactroy Support Bundle, this will help me to configure a repository with similar settings.
You may upload the files using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:
curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184057/"
Looking forward to your update.

02s6900002PANkgAAH5006900003jaZoKAAU[#183938] Verizon Communications Inc. Jfrog supportHi Vineeth,

Thanks for waiting. On our upcoming call I plan to investigate a file within the _pre uploads folder, it appears to have a problematic permission issue.

The logs you sent this morning state that there is a permission denial error for a file within the _pre directory. This directory is usually reserved for uploads, and we did move the parent "data" folder during our emergency upgrade on Friday. I suspect we will need to manually reupload the file within this folder, or delete it to complete the migration:

2021-10-25T19:20:29.599Z [jfrt ] [DEBUG] [f5118e649bc702fc] [a.c.i.ConanLocalInterceptor:97] [art-exec-11         ] - Checking if 'ennor/OmnitureFramework/3.119/stable/0/package/9868ac1289a37d9a0e3595f3b350473745debec1/0/.timestamp' is a potential for Conan v1 deployment

Access to file denied null

If possible we should adjust the permissions on this file and then reboot Artifactory, the migration may complete. Failing that, we should delete the file from the Artifactory repository to complete the migration, we can make a backup copy of it first.

I will be able to assist you with doing these actions in about an hour, let me know if you have any questions about this game plan.

Patrick Russell

I would like to follow up to see if you have any additional updates on the origin of these properties.

In artifactory-splunk integration, we’re sending all the attributes provided in artifactory logs to splunk. The mentioned attributes are not available in the artifactory logs and there is no way to extract these parameters and send them to splunk. There is also no way to add attributes to artifactory logs. However, you can add attributes in the fluentd configuration and send them to splunk (provided the users fill out the values for these attributes manually or in some other way in fluent config files). This is why we want to know the origin of these attribute data. Thank you.

Best regards,
Paul Pan

02s6900002PANk3AAH5006900003MpcbuAAB[#179755] Download request for repo:path forbidden for userHi Team,

Thank you for joining the sesison.
During the session, we have verified the users for both Steve and Harry and could see that both users present in LDAP and SAML.

Now headed to test for Steve for SAML login, where he has generated a new API Token after he logged into UI. Later when he ran the curl call do download the artifacts with the API Key,

Similarly we tested for another SAML user, Harry, where he regenerated the API Key, and later he was able to download the artifacts.

We requested to test for few random files and all the downloads were successful. The issue must be with the old API Keys and regeneration must have fixed the issue.

As we discussed, we will keep this ticket open for 2 days. If the users complain about this issue, you would reach out to us. If not, we are safe to close. We will wait for your update.

02s6900002PANmmAAH50069000035ZcyIAAS[#175030] X-Ray : Showing wrong package in Impact pathHi Nana/Someshwer,

Thank you for joining the session with me.

Over the call, we extracted the affected docker layer where we noticed the “.cache” folder inside the Cypress package in the affecting docker layer containing the other NPM packages and that is the reason we see the vulnerabilities for the  Cypress package in the Packages screen.

As a next step, I will check internally regarding the “.cache” folder and get back to you with more information.

Also, we have discussed the other issue where we noticed the discrepancy in the vulnerabilities count while pointing to the NPM registry and with the Xray instance. When you point to an Xray instance we see 3 vulnerabilities (1 Critical, 1 high,  1 medium) whereas when you point directly to “NPM Registry'' we see no vulnerabilities. The NPM client version used at your end is 6.14.15.

As agreed over the call, you will be sharing the “Package.json” file which has the reported behavior to investigate the issue further?

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for your response.


Based on our previous experience, the described behavior can occur when there is a discrepancy between the Artifactory database and the filestore

Please see the following script regarding the discrepancies between the Artifactory database and the filestore:

Artifactory Filestore Integrity Checker

The above script will give us a clear picture of discrepancies between the database and the filestore.

We see the problem both:

* in the artifactory UI


We usually see it first when building, then we go onto the artifactory site to explore and see it there too

That page doesn't work for me. It just comes up with a grey box in the middle, with text that says "This page is not available." I've tried 2 different browsers on 2 different computers.


But anyway, we are still seeing instances of this problem, but they seem to be transient and clear up after a few hours. For example, yesterday we saw it with

https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/io/netty/netty-bom/4.1.60.Final/netty-bom-4.1.60.Final.pom
https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/org/apache/cassandra/cassandra-all/3.11.5/cassandra-all-3.11.5.pom

but those were working this morning.


This afternoon (about 12:20 pm EDT) we saw it with

https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/org/apache/cassandra/cassandra-thrift/3.11.5/cassandra-thrift-3.11.5.pom
https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/org/hibernate/hibernate-validator/4.3.0.Final/hibernate-validator-4.3.0.Final.pom
https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/libs-release/it/unimi/dsi/fastutil/6.5.7/fastutil-6.5.7.pom

It seems to occur when we add 1 or more new dependencies to a build but we can't make it happen deterministically. It looks like there is some chance with every new un-cached item for the pointer to the host repo to get broken by adding a trailing '/' as previously described.

We typically see it with our most commonly used virtual repo "libs-release", though the underlying problem has so far always been in our "central" maven repo. (pointing at maven central).


Can you take a look at today's logs and see if you can find anything? It looks like it is related to how the remote URL gets generated.


thanks,

--Andy

This is *not* the only package where we have seen the problem.

We have seen it with

· the pom for "com.datastax.oss:java-driver-mapper-runtime:4.13.0"

o has since then started working

· the pom for "org.apache.cassandra:apache-cassandra:3.11.5"

o has since then started working

· the jar for "ch.qos.logback:logback-core:1.1.3"

o still broken

o go to https://tamr.jfrog.io/ui/native/central/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.1.3

o click on "logback-core-1.1.3.jar"

· the pom for "org.jamon:jamon-runtime:2.3.1"

o has since then started working

We don't know how to make it happen for a particular package; it just happens sometimes when we are pulling a new dependency (one that is not already cached in artifactory).



Here's how it looked for an instance of the problem, the jar for "ch.qos.logback:logback-core:1.1.3":


For us, this shows up at https://tamr.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/central%2Fch%2Fqos%2Flogback%2Flogback-core%2F1.1.3%2Flogback-core-1.1.3.jar

If you go to that page, you can see that the jar is not cached:





opening that "URL to file:" https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/central/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.1.3/logback-core-1.1.3.jar

you get:





Looking at the parent dir, you see



clicking on the pom will download it successfully

but clicking on the jar...



note that the URL in the message has a trailing slash:

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.1.3/logback-core-1.1.3.jar/



If we open that directly:



But if we remove the trailing "/" it works

We updated that setting on our remote repositories but are still getting errors. This does not appear to be every package that is being effected. When we most recently tried getting `org.jamon:jamon-runtime:2.3.1 we got the following error which had the same issue of adding a trialing / to the request

02s6900002PANbfAAH5006900003MqRTRAA3Re: [#180402] NPM dist-tags not respected by virtual repositoryHi Prasanna,
I am seeing the same behavior with all new repositories.
First I tested with the existing repositories in our test installation and confirmed that I'm seeing the same behavior, ruling out errors with the internal state of our prod instance.
Then (still in our test installation), I set up four new repos: paul-npm-local, paul-npm-remote (npmjs.org), paul-npm-sinopia (the same internal sinopia registry that the existing repos point to), and paul-npm-virtual (aggregate the previous three). Before publishing anything to these repos, I ran "npm view gitlabci-npm-artifactory" and the "next" version was 0.3.31. Then I published a version with a next tag, then one without, then one more with. The last version I published was v0.3.37. If I look at this version in the Artifactory web interface I can see that the "npm.disttag" property is set to "next", but when I ran "npm view gitlabci-npm-artifactory" again it still shows 0.3.31 as the "next" version.
I've attached the logs from our test instance in case that helps.
Thanks,Paul Page

Usually, we perform the upgrade once the new version gets released and this upgrade will be performed on weekends during non-traffic hours and it will be performed in batches i.e we upgrade only a few customers every weekend. A notification will be sent two weeks prior to the upgrade. If any actions are required from you, it will be available in the notification email. You can respond to the email or open a ticket with us if you would like to postpone the upgrades after receiving the notification.

I hope the provided information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any additional questions, I'll be glad to assist you.

We hit this. Noticed that `curl would download the native html file, while the browser instead downloaded some jfrog javascript. That led me to a google search for "artifactory user agent" which led me to that ticket (and several others). Setting artifactory.redirect.native.browser.requests.to.ui=false got back the original behavior of file download links just downloading the file.
Seems VERY strange to me that I was able to find issues in your issue tracker faster than you, considering that there are a number of customers reporting the same behavior. Even weirder that a minor update would change the behavior of a something as fundamental as downloading files, with no mention in the release notes, and defaulting to on.
I suppose you can close the ticket. Thanks for your help and super fast response time.

[ External sender. Exercise caution. ]

Hello Graeme,

In the session, we first discussed the usePresigning settings. The 5GB limit is on AWS single request limit and it can't be changed. For now, we suggest to first disabling usePresigning setting in binarystore.xml.

We also found out that there are some settings issues with buildInfo replication and after tunning the configDescriptors, we are able to replicate buildInfo.

In logs, we are still seeing many 413 request entity too large error. We have modified tomcat and nginx settings but it still didn't help. Since we noticed that the disk space is filling up more than 95%, we suggest to first trying to scale up disk space and artifactory could also throw 413 error when there's not enough diskspace.

If you still see issues after disabling presigning and with enough disk space, please reach out to us. Thank you.

Best regards,
Paul Pan

We are looking for a way to export artifactory usage and repository metrics to prometheus to display in grafana.
We know there is a prometheus exporter out there for artifactory but it looks like it needs to be installed along side the application. 
Because we are on SaaS we know we do not have access to install items like this. Do you know if there is anything available for us to get metrics into grafana about repo usage, data usage/storage, and general metrics that would be provided by that in our SaaS service?

02s6900002PANo9AAH5006900003YgEPxAAN[#183320] Propagation is not allowed while current member is not boundHi Alex,

I've been looking through this case for a bit today, it's strange as this isn't an error we've seen before so I'm checking the code to see where the error gets thrown. There isn't much information there though, so I looked into your other tickets to gather some more logs of the event and saw that 183025 had a support bundle from a9y-master-c from Oct 18-19. I wanted to check that node out specifically since you mentioned restarting it seemed to fix issues on your end. Looking at the bundle I found the propagation errors seemed to coincide with errors in the Access service, and checking those out I saw

Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create native thread: possibly out of memory or process/resource limits reached

which is strange as I see

"-Xms8g",
      "-Xmx60g",

which should be more than enough. Where this error is coming from is the fact that there are 31.7k threads in the thread dump for a9y-master-c, it would seem like something is stuck there but there are no blocked threads. Rather it seems most of the threads are in a simple waiting state and are delayed or put on hold by the scheduler.

I checked internally about these stack traces and this behaviour and came across a thread leak we had found in the code that was causing thousand (and in your cases tens of thousands) of these threads to show up and clog the machine, eventually leading to the out of memory errors and failures across the board. I have compared your thread dump and errors with the ones we had reproduced and analyzed and everything was the same, but that JIRA was fixed in 7.17.2 while you're on 7.25.7. It looks like there might be a regression here so I'm bringing this up to our developers to look into and if there's a temporary workaround while we check this out. This seems to only be happening on a single node but I don't have enough logs to confirm the other ones, are you seeing the thread starvation or memory issues on any other nodes? Are all nodes on 7.25.7? If this is only happening on one node, does turning off that one node fix the issue?

The tar files have few entries. Two of the files this problem was encountered with last week contain 1 (war file), and the other 5 (two jar files and sh scripts).

FWIW, I had to delete and recreate the repository for another issue (#183949), and the files downloaded immediately without issue when I attempted just now. Does the Edge system store some repository cache despite the repository being deleted and recreated, or is this slowness possibly an early symptom of the other issue that causes it to stop responding to any request?

Thank you for joining the session with us today during the session we tried to enable ( Local - Local) replication from on-prem to saas instance to push the local packages available in the on-prem PyPi local repository.

Since we do not have anyone available with "Admin" access during our session we were unable to complete the Replication.

As discussed please enable local to local replication from on-prem to saas following below steps:

Navigating to on-prem instance $Artifactory_UI --> Admin --> Repositories --> "PyPI local" --> Replication --> Add new replication by pointing the URL to Saas local repository ( created in our screen-sharing session )
Update the Saas instance Admin credentials in the "Username" and Password" fields.
Enable "Event" based Replciation so that the Artifacts will be synced and replicated between on-prem to a Saas.


Please configure the replication and revert back to us if you are facing any issues during the setup.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for reaching out to JFrog support. From the logs sent we are noticing that there is more than one node is set as the primary.

2021-10-25 15:30:23,159 [https-jsse-nio-8443-exec-23] [ERROR] (o.a.a.AddonsManagerImpl:943) - Could not verify running primary
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Found 2 running primary nodes where only 1 is allowed.

Please note that only one primary is allowed in the HA cluster. Please check if HA is enabled in the ha-node.properties. You will need to disable one of them and restart the Artifactory instances. If the issue persists, please send me the Artifactory support bundle. I would like to verify the configuration files. The bundle can be sent using the curl command below.

curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184101/"

Hello Soly,
We found this issue only on a couple of react NPN packages.
In short, we have a policy with a list of allowed licenses and we trigger a violation if an artifact has an unknown license.
In this artifact, you can see that a violation was triggered because an "Unknown License", but the license is correctly discovered (MIT - and actually it is an allowed license):
We were able to temporarily sort this out using the "XRay / Ignore Rules" feature.
Let me know if you have any other questions.
Best regards.

·         will it scan what's already there, or just on request, and if it will, is that a nightly scan?

·         How do we report the findings?  I do not see reports or a generate report button?

Original Question –

We created a mount point for the data directory.  But I cannot find where we tell XRay to use that data mount.

Can you help me figure that out?  I assume we need to put that mount point here or symlink to it:  /base/vendor/jfrog/xray/data

I may have found the root cause of this issue. Its due to the immense size of the XRay database left no space left in the DB server. After adding additional disk capacity, the initial sync completed got completed and now the database size grew up to 86 GB.
So, how big is this vulnerability database expected to grow? Does it really take up to 200+ GB of disk space?

02s6900002PANt9AAH5006900003jaiwEAAQ[#184105] Recent malicious code detected in ua-parser-js 0.7.29Hi Matt,

In regards to the UAParser.js package, I checked on the package and could see that the affected versions (0.7.29, 0.8.0, 1.0.0) are not available in the npm remote registry so unless this was downloaded before it was blocked, you will not be able to download the affected versions any more as they are deleted from the remote as seen here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js.

As for the question on assigning a custom issue and then having that shown in the npm audit, it is possible. This functionality will be enabled by default on npm virtual repositories that aggregate at least one remote repository that supports npm audit. For example, a remote repository that points to https://registry.npmjs.org or Artifactory Smart Remote repository. I was able to test this on my side. I created a virtual repository test-npm that had a remote repository test-npm-remote pointing to https://registry.npmjs.org. Then I did an npm install of the ua-parser-js package. Since the current version does not have a vulnerability I did not see any security issue. I then assigned a custom critical issue to this package. Then uninstalled it from my local and then tried an install and could see this info:



I could also see the below info for npm audit which is provided by Xray:



I suspect that you have the npm remote repository set as the npm registry, please try once with the virtual repository and check if this works.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

02s6900002PANt1AAH5006900003YgNt9AAF[#183561] Artifactory Upgrade ConfirmationHi Leo,

Thank you for your response.

Regarding the warning message about having multiple Artifactory instances connected to a single Xray instance, this was possible in the previous Artifactory 6.x and Xray 2.x versions. However, from Artifactory 7.x and Xray 3.x, it is not possible to connect Xray to multiple Artifactory instances. Xray must be connected to a single Artifactory instance.
As you're already using the 7.x & 3.x version of Artifactory and Xray, you can ignore the warning message and proceed with the upgrade.

I hope this answers your question. Please let me know if you have further questions and I will be glad to assist you.

I wanted to follow up as I have been looking into the OOM error you mentioned.  Around that OOM error, I wanted to see the logs around this time.  We see the following errors and a 5 hour skip where there are no logs:

2021-10-21T13:18:39.379Z [36m[jfrou][0m [31;1m[ERROR][0m [5b4976cd5ba76eb8] [local_topology.go:123         ] [main                ] - periodic send heartbeat failed for 12 consecutive times.

Last error: failed sending heartbeat information to Access: failed closing Access grpc client: closing heartbeat client and waiting for response timed-out

After this skip, we then see the OOM errors after what looks to be a restart.  Does this line up with the restart?  Artifactory looks to run into isssues, a restart is run and then we see memory issues?  We would also like to take a look at the catalina/localhost logs around this time as well.

Looking further into these Access server logs, we see no issues with the server at this time, but do see some warnings around the restart.

We do see you have 16GB set for Xmx.  What does the Artifactory server have as available heap memory?  Do we have the memory Artifactory is using on average?  Does it stay around the top end of the set 16 GB?  Looking forward to hearing from you with this information.

02s6900002PANs2AAH5006900003Yg7cWAAR[#183209] pipelines not working after upgradeHi Sandeep,

Thank you for meeting with the Pipelines dev team and me today. We were able to provide an estimate on when two of the remaining UI concerns are going to be resolved, and I need to re-escalate the issue to the right team in order to make progress on the auto-refresh problem.

On the call we went over the main UI concerns. The "Logs disappearing" and the "Lingering UI too zoomed in" UI issues are going to be resolved in the next upcoming patch for Pipelines. While it's hard to say when this fix is going to be released, rest assured we are working towards resolving these specific issues.

This leaves the remaining auto-refresh problem. Unfortunately there doesn't look to be any problem in the JFrog Pipelines application itself. The Pipelines dev team was unable to pin down why a 404 Not Found is being returned from the Router system.

Originally I had escalated this issue to the Router team, but they told me to take it to the Pipelines team. On our call we produced hard evidence that there is a problem with the WebSocket protocol in particular. In our test, we used a special curl command to simulate a "ws" protocol request.

This request failed to reach the Pipelines Router when done through Artifactory. We also confirmed that regular HTTP / HTTPS requests are able to be handled, this explains why the rest of the UI and build systems function as intended.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns from our meeting today. I need to take these findings back to our Router dev team to determine the next steps. My hope is to have an update for you by either tomorrow or the day after that.

Best regards,
Patrick Russell

Thanks for sending in the system.yaml files. The join.key seems to be encrypted, which might be causing issues with reading the key. If you already have a $JFROG_HOME/var/etc/security/join.key, you do not need to add it to the system.yaml. You can delete the join.key entry from the system.yaml if this is the case.

If you need to create a new join.key, please refer to the documentation below.

Yes, that version of artifactory is supported with version 3.34.1 of xray. However, it would be recommended to upgrade to 7.27.3 to utilize all of the new features within xray.

02s6900002PANvAAAX5006900003jaiMQAAY[#184077] failed s3 replcation escalationHello Graeme,

The first error indicates possible race condition or error with replicating the actual artifacts:

2021-10-26 02:10:27,908 [http-nio-8081-exec-2] [ERROR] (o.a.e.UploadServiceImpl:321) - Failed to deploy properties to 'splunkcore-latest:manual-build/windows/intel/64/splunk/8.2.2110/8.2.2110/splunk-8.2.2110-ad20f3507e4e-windows-64.zip'

... 61 lines omitted ...
	at org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java:81)
... 11 lines omitted ...
Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: insert or update on table "node_props" violates foreign key constraint "node_props_nodes_fk"


Artifactory is trying to replicate properties but the actual file is not there. This could be either the file was not yet replicated, replicated but deleted or is being replicating. We need to check other log messages related to "splunkcore-latest:manual-build/windows/intel/64/splunk/8.2.2110/8.2.2110/splunk-8.2.2110-ad20f3507e4e-windows-64.zip“

The second EntityTooLarge is still related to filestore. Have you removed the preSign settings and rolling restarted artifactory?

I can join your call at 1PM PST. Let me know if that works for you.

Further checking the configurations at your end, I see “Enable Token Authentication” is disabled, If you are proxying the URL in the docker remote repository make sure to check the option “Enable Token Authentication”  (these are the default settings). Please refer to the following documentation for further information.

Kindly check the “Enable Token Authentication” option as shown in the below screenshot and see if you are able to download the image.

02s6900002PANwrAAH5006900003YgBxjAAF[#183290] Setup a docker WINDOWS remote repository for https://mcr.microsoft.comHello Thomas,

Thank you and your team for joining the remote session with me earlier.
Please review a brief overview of what we tested and confirmed today:

We tested the following in the call:

Confirm the configuration of the docker remote repository for any possible issues. Configuration was default other than a forward proxy.
Confirmed linux machine can pull linux images from remote repository without issue.
Confirmed windows machine can pull images from mcr.microsoft.com directly without issue, but the same image being served from Artifactory returns "unknown blob".
Confirmed the customer's Docker Desktop was in the windows container mode.

To continue troubleshooting this issue, please use the below procedure to enable the docker debug loggers:

Modify the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/logback.xml file and add the following loggers to the end of the file(within the </configuration> tag):

<logger name="org.jfrog.repomd.docker">
  <level value="trace"/>
</logger>
<logger name="org.artifactory.addon.docker">
  <level value="trace"/>
</logger>


Once the loggers are in place, please allow a few minutes for the logback configuration to reload and perform the following steps

Run the pull test for the linux image we tested in the session (restapifuzztesting/agent-utilities:v4.0.1)
Have Samuel run the pull request on the windows:20H2 image.

Once the above two tests are completed, please disable the loggers to prevent overloading the logs and create a Support Bundle or zip/archive the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/log directory and upload it to our support log dropbox:

curl -i -T bundle.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/183290/"

Please provide me with a general timestamp for when the above tests were completed so I can find the logs easier.

Please let me know if you need any assistance with the above recommendations. I look forward to your response.

Andrew Grosskurth

02s6900002PANxVAAX5006900003jaiwsAAA[#184107] Xray Setup -- Urgent Security NeedHi Brian,

The install.sh interactive script should have prompted you for the data directory location. If Xray is installed already, you can copy the current data directory "/var/opt/jfrog/xray/data" to the mount location, create a symlink pointing /var/opt/jfrog/xray/data -> mount location, and make sure the mount location is owned by xray:xray.

Also, Xray can scan existing artifacts, but first you should complete the DB sync . You will need to add the repository for indexing , and then you can click on the "index existing" button on the row of the repo you selected for indexing. Afterwards, you can create a watch and policy to generate violations. There are also reports you can create.

Matthew Wang

We tried with local 'admin' user, and now the xray has no artifactory connection defined. We tried to re create the connection, but it complains that artifactory is already connected to another xray, on proceeding it just fails the request.

can we do a screen share? I have every one on this side on a call now. please send a zoom link.


Thankyou,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#184204] Xray is not available

Hello Steve,

  Since from logs xray server is running fine, can you try this API to reset connections from Artifacotry to xray?



curl -u<xray_username>:<xray_password> -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<xray_host>/api/v1/internal/binMgr/reconnect -d

'{"binMgrId":"<Artifactory_Id_Intergrated>","binMgrUrl":"Artifactory_url", "username":"Art_USER", "password":"Art_password" }'

02s6900002PAO00AAH5006900003jaeNRAAY[#184009] Artifactory not starting up - config error in logsHi Marla,

Thank you for the update.
With regards to the "artifactory.config.latest.xml" file, the file gets updated whenever there's a change made with the Artifactory configuration.
It's hard to determine what caused the config to be modified, deleting the <repoKey> parameter, but the change was made and it was saved into the config.latest.xml file.

You may find older config.xml files with timestamps in the same folder,

-rw-r----- 1 root root 151670 Oct 19 18:29 artifactory.config.latest.1634668154969.xml -rw-r----- 1 root root 151546 Oct 21 21:11 artifactory.config.latest.1634850695415.xml -rw-r----- 1 root root 151670 Oct 21 21:13 artifactory.config.latest.1634850808947.xml -rw-r----- 1 root root 151570 Oct 22 17:44 artifactory.config.latest.1634924689351.xml -rw-r----- 1 root root 151529 Oct 22 17:46 artifactory.config.latest.1634924812416.xml
-rw-r----- 1 root root 151570 Oct 22 17:47 artifactory.config.latest.xml

You can check these files and compare them with the corrupted config file to see when the change was made.

Also, if you keep a daily backup of Artifactory, you can find a backup copy of the config file inside the backup folder and use that file to restore Artifactory.

/opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/backup/artifactory/backup-daily/current# ls -al

Hi John,

Thank you for getting back to me.

The reason for the wildcard certificate requirement is related to the Docker Access Method being used.
As your server configuration is using the Sub-domain method<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/HTTP+Settings#HTTPSettings-UsingSubdomain>, configuring a wildcard certificate will allow accessing different docker repositories in the following way:

<DockerRepoName>.delivery.mi.medical.canon

This information/requirement indeed missing from our official docs, and I'll make sure to update this KB<https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/how-to-configure-custom-cname-for-artifactory-cloud/> with the relevant information.
Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

I hope this clarifies and I look forward to your next response.

02s6900002PAO1hAAH5006900003MpYorAAF[#179696] Issues on port 8046Hi Mike,

Regarding the node name in the UI, we have confirmed that the parameter which displays in the UI of the artifactory monitoring page is the node-id that is set in the system-yaml.

If the node-id is not set in the system-yaml it is calculated by the following:
node-id = echo -n "$(hostname)"
node-name = echo -n "$(hostname -s)"

The only possible way the value in system yaml gets replaced is if the environment variables are set manually.

JF_SHARED_NODE_ID
JF_SHARED_NODE_NAME

Please note that if the above env variables are set then it will always get precedence over system yaml value set. Looking through the scripts you had sent we didn't see that this was set, but we wanted to double check with you as this would explain the behavior.

Regarding access intermittently failing, we are currently focusing on this error:
[31m[WARN ][0m [573db38906bd84d9] [join_executor.go:192          ] [main                ] - Cluster join: Error during cluster join: Error response from service registry, status code: 409; message: Requested Router Join for nodeId: ec2fa5c68bbd773e56e902521cfc238d at: 10.233.10.86 conflicts (node id) with existing node: ServiceNodeImpl(serviceId=jffe@000, nodeId=ec2fa5c68bbd773e56e902521cfc238d, routerId=ec2fa5c68bbd773e56e902521cfc238d, state=UNHEALTHY, created=1633213628078, lastUpdated=1633213628078, version=null, revision=null, ip=10.233.10.17, endpoints=[EndpointImpl(port=8082, secure=false, paths=[/ui/(.*), /ui, /])]); Retrying...

After working with our r&d team we believe that this is the cause of the behavior. If a server is killed ungracefully - not allowing the server to unregister and, then started again immediately (before the old entry of the topology is considered stale) which would result in access not allowing his router to register which would prevent startup. A simple "workaround" is to wait after ungraceful shutdown before starting the server again.

This behavior would also explain the node.id name issue. The old entry isn't deleted because the shutdown wasn't graceful so the node didn't unregister from the topology, which would cause the node id to change as there cannot be two nodes with the same node id. To confirm this please provide us with the shutdown process of the unhealthy node and how long you are waiting before spinning up the new node after shutting the old node off.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Mari

Part of this appears to be NOT working.API Key seems to work when federated across and used.Token is still broken.
API KEY:curl -uw011285:<api-key-here> -XGET "https://containers-read-us-east-1-b.dev.aws.jpmchase.net/artifactory/api/security/users"
SUCCESS - Returns the expected JSON

TOKEN:curl -H"Authorization: Bearer <token-here>" -XGET "https://containers-read-us-east-1-b.dev.aws.jpmchase.net/artifactory/api/security/users"

FAIL: {
 "errors" : [ {
   "status" : 401,
   "message" : "Can't reauthenticate LDAP for user: 'w011285': user is locked, disabled or does not exist in LDAP"
 } ]
}

Using that same token on the on-prem (which has connectivity to ldap), it works. 
TOKEN (to on-prem instance): curl -H"Authorization: Bearer <token-here>" -XGET "https://containerregistry-na-dev.apps.mt-d3.belv.gkp.jpmchase.net/artifactory/api/security/users"
SUCCESS - Expected JSON is returned.

I created a fresh token, just prior to making those API calls.I do have the following set (maybe you can tell me if there is a way to validate it is on):artifactory.ldap.apply.headless.validation=false

Needless to say, this is the highest priority because we have been waiting on this a long time and now that we are able to validate it, it doesn't appear to be fully working.
Can we get on a call to dive in and make sure I'm not misconfiguring or missing something?

Thank you for your patience and glad to hear the upgrade was sucessful. I checked internally and the service monitoring the frontend version is currently a known issue, however it is currently safe to ignore.

Regarding the "General tab". Are you able to test this on another browser? It seems other users have seen this behavior on Google Chrome browsers specifically. This should just be a UI issue.

  Looking through your notes, the deletion you see from feisa @ 2021-10-21T05:24:26.645Z is in-fact a restore from the trash-can. The prior downloads are our install process finally proceeding after locating the files. The question is what caused the files to be deleted, so looking further up (older) in the log file, can you find the source deletion?

Thanks

As you can see from the above that the file "yum-crabel-prod-rhel8-gcc8/crabel-logserver-1.34-1496.cts_19.14.15.el8.x86_64.rpm" has been deleted as part of the Trash Can by the user "feisa@crabel.com" at "2021-10-21T05:24:26.645Z". Can you please confirm if the user "feisa@crabel.com" has cleaned the Trash Can? I am asking this as I can see that the file was downloaded by the "rpmpublisher" user three times after the DELETE operation.

Also, can you please check if you are able to run the Rest API for the user plugin "cleanup" as mentioned in this confluence page - https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-RetrievePluginCode



GET /api/plugins/download/cleanup
I am asking this because I checked internally and I could find that you have the below files present in the "$JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/plugins" location -



artifactCleanup.json

artifactCleanup.groovy

cleanDockerImages.properties

cleanDockerImages.groovy

oldBuildCleanup.groovy
By referring to these files I can see that you are using the below user plugins -



"cleanupCtl" - https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins/tree/master/cleanup/artifactCleanup

Related files - artifactCleanup.json and artifactCleanup.groovy



"cleanOldBuilds" - https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins/tree/master/cleanup/oldBuildCleanup

Related files - oldBuildCleanup.groovy



"cleanDockerImages" - https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins/tree/master/cleanup/cleanDockerImages

Related files - cleanDockerImages.properties and cleanDockerImages.groovy






However, I could not find the files related to the user plugin "cleanup" in our repository - https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins/tree/master/cleanup. I would like to know which plugin is it. Can you please check and confirm if you have the link for this user plugin?

I will be waiting for your response.

we are planning to add exclude pattern or block some how to not download few specific npm package versions "ua-parser-js versions 0.7.29, 0.8.0, and 1.0.0" because they are compromised and having some malicious software embedded in those versions.In artifactory npm-remote repo, I have added exclude pattern for specific version , so it won't even download into artifactory but not sure whether those work or not, to confirm checking with you whether excluding specific versions is possible ? if not , what is the alternative solution ?Anyway we have Xray in place, so it scans the dependencies and blocks users to download. but what I am trying to achieve here is to block those versions even downloading into artifactory.

02s6900002PAO47AAH5006900003jaiZwAAI[#184092] Unable to download docker images.Hello Anuj,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

From the provided error, x509: certificate is valid for *.devops.a.bill.com, not artifactory, this may be an issue with the number of subdomains.  Since the error indicates the certificate is for *.devops.a.bill.com not for artifactory, the reverse proxy may be having issues interpreting the full subdomain.

As a next step, please provide me with the following information:
1. Run the following command and provide me with the output:
a. docker login artifactory.devops.a.bill.com
b. openssl s_client -showcerts -connect https://artifactory.devops.a.bill.com
2. Confirm that the repository name is artifactory

Refer to The Subdomain Method documentation for more information on setting up docker using the subdomain method.

Please reproduce the issue and upload a full support bundle and the /etc/hosts file for me to review.

You can gather the Artifactory logs into a support bundle by going to Admin -> Advanced -> Support Zone. Please create and download the bundle and note the time of the error if possible.

Then send me everything. You can send me your files using the following curl command. This will deploy them to our “Supportlogs” Artifactory SaaS instance:

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184092/ "

You can also try uploading the files to the Supportlogs UI.  Be sure to include your ticket in the upload path (E.G. 184092/filename.ext).

02s6900002PAO4RAAX5006900003jaSdvAAE[#183752] Builds are failing with 'peer not authenticated' errorHi Ferenc,

Thank you for getting back to us with the details. I would request you to refer below with regards to your queries:

Query1: Until then could you please tell us that Where is located this mentioned „Java truststore”? Should we import the SSL certificate into this file to solve the issue?
Response: If you are using Artifactory v7.x you can perform either of the below options in order to trust a new certificate:
1. Place the certificate under the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/security/keys/trusted directory
2. Adding the certificate to the application's Java KeyStore.

However for Jenkins, you need to import the Artifactory certificate into the truststore used by Jenkins in order to establish the trust between Jenkins and Artifactory application.

Query2: Are there any changes needs to be done with the artifactory configurations?
Response: If you have already followed either of the options as described above which is good to trust a new certificate. You may also try restarting the Jenkins and let us know the results.

Query3: Is it okay if the certificates are downloaded via browser and generated .pem wih openssl?
Response: As you have confirmed that you have downloaded the certificate from the browser, could you please download the certificate(with .crt format) as mentioned below using the openssl command. And as we see the peer not authenticated error while connecting to the Artifactory application at the Jenkins machine, as the certificate of the Artifactory server is not recognized by the Jenkins JVM. Further could you please retrieve the certificate using the below openssl command, import the self-signed certificate into the truststore used by Jenkins, and let us know the outcome. You may refer to the external link here on the same.

> openssl s_client -connect <secure authentication server IP and port> -showcerts < /dev/null > server.crt


Also, if feasible in order to rule out the issues with the certificates, kindly configure with the direct HTTP Artifactory URL at the Jenkins end and let us know the outcome.

I will be happy to hop on a session with you if the issue still persists even after importing the certificate into the Jenkins truststore.

02s6900002PAO4qAAH5006900003MnMlCAAVRe: [#178334] Xray U Fixed version incorrectTo reproduce:Browse to job to check current scan status:Job does not show the javassist artifact in the violations tab or the security tab. But it is listed as a descendant with the triangle which means it has vulnerability.. See screenshot
Locate the artifact in the tree browser:Shows 1 violation and one security using a watch that scans just the repository content. See screenshot.
I rescanned the single artifact above using the actions button. Selected scan for violations. Waited 5 minutes.Refreshed page.Page now shows ONLY 1 violation and 0 security. See screenshot.
Now to scan the build:
Create 2 policies:	Security: CVSS score 9-10, generate violation, fail build.	Banned License: add allowed license, generate violation, fail build.Create watch called gailtest- add build and above 2 policies to watch.
Go to the watch, which only has the one job in it. Select apply on content, last 7 days. Wait 5 minutes.
Then go to watch violations in the UI under security and complianceThere are no violations listed. See screen shot.
Go to the build in artifactory select Atifactrory in the left panel, then select builds, No change. Job does not show the javassist artifact in the violations tab or the security tab. But it is listed as a descendant.
it is confusing. If the artifacts were updated in the background, as stated in issue #1, then I should not see an inconsistency in my ui in regard to a single artifact, whether it exists in a build or alone outside of the build.
Hopefully that is the reproduction steps you were after.

Are you using the repo path method, correct?

If so, the url to use for docker pulls should be something similar to the following:

docker pull / push <Artifactory Host IP Address>/<REPOSITORY_KEY>/<IMAGE>:<TAG>

Since this is the same convention that you are using please send me the complete docker login and pull commands being used along with their output. After the issue has been reproduced, please send a support bundle as well.

You can send me your files with the following curl command:

curl -i -T filename.ext “https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184111/”

Can you please share how to backout the upgrade if something goes wrong? What is necessary to backout the upgrade to restore system back to version 6.6.5 if something goes wrong. This is a physical server so I don't have the option to take a snapshot. What is the recommended version of artifactory we should upgrade to? can we go straight to that version or do we have to upgrade to intermediate version first? Will the artifactory version 7.x be compatible with our current DB: MySQL community: 5.6.29-2? Also in the upgrade doc: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/What%27s+New%3A+Self-Hosted#What'sNew:Self-Hosted-Prem-DeprecatedFeaturesit mentions several times about Xray and a couple of other applications, how do I know if we are using any of these: XRay, Mission Control, Distribution? I'm fairly new to artifactory so I'm not familar with these other apps.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Have you added this repository to a Watch yet and created any Policies with which to scan it?

This is generally a necessary step to make sure that the full scanning process, including indexing can complete.

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray#ConfiguringXray-CreatingWatchesandPolicies

Additionally, it appears that the support bundle sent to this ticket was for Artifactory. Assuming that the above steps do not fix the issue, I will need to see a support bundle from Xray to look into this further.




Looking forward to your response.

02s6900002PAO9HAAX5006900003jaidlAAA[#184094] cargo package resolve errrorHello Shuang,

Nice to meet you. Thank you for the updates. It does look like you ran into a similar issue in the JIRA you mentioned but it may be adjacently related.

The .git folder is for the metadata of these repositories and their indexed resources. I would not recommend deleting the .git every time from Artifactory as part of the CI job. The indexing should not take too long for 30 artifacts but as your repository increases so may indexing time.

From the log snippet, you provided it looks like there may have been an issue with reading a particular file. After you removed the .git folder for the repository and reindexed the repo did that resolve the issue?

Hi Brian,

The install.sh interactive script should have prompted you for the data directory location. If Xray is installed already, you can copy the current data directory "/var/opt/jfrog/xray/data" to the mount location, create a symlink pointing /var/opt/jfrog/xray/data -> mount location, and make sure the mount location is owned by xray:xray.

Subject: [#183624] Enabling SSH for Artifactory

Hi Leelavathi,

Thank you for your patience while I was further looking into the SSH configuration issue.

I deployed an Artifactory installation using the default values.yaml file and set the artifactory.ssh.enabled to true as shown in the previous message.



artifactory:

  ssh:

    enabled: true

    internalPort: 1339

    externalPort: 1339
As well as the nginx.ssh values:



nginx:

    ssh:

      internalPort: 1339

      externalPort: 1339

Then, once I deployed Artifactory and logged in to the nginx pod and checked the nginx.conf file under the /etc/nginx directory and noticed that it was populated with the ssh settings:



bash-5.1$ cat nginx.conf

# Main Nginx configuration file

worker_processes  4;

error_log  /var/opt/jfrog/nginx/logs/error.log warn;

pid        /tmp/nginx.pid;

## SSH Server Configuration

stream {

  server {

    listen 1339;

    proxy_pass artifactory:1339;

  }

}

Are you able to see that the SSH information was successfully populated in the nginx.conf file? Can you share the first block of this file?

Looking forward to your response.

[ External sender. Exercise caution. ]

Hello Graeme,

In the session, we first discussed the usePresigning settings. The 5GB limit is on AWS single request limit and it can't be changed. For now, we suggest to first disabling usePresigning setting in binarystore.xml.

We also found out that there are some settings issues with buildInfo replication and after tunning the configDescriptors, we are able to replicate buildInfo.

In logs, we are still seeing many 413 request entity too large error. We have modified tomcat and nginx settings but it still didn't help. Since we noticed that the disk space is filling up more than 95%, we suggest to first trying to scale up disk space and artifactory could also throw 413 error when there's not enough diskspace.

If you still see issues after disabling presigning and with enough disk space, please reach out to us. Thank you.

Best regards,

I have noticed that on the recent export i have been trying it is missing an access.bootstrap.json file which may explain why the identities info didn't get imported. I'm not sure if this is a consequence of disabling encryption before doing the export or not. We are looking into trying to get another export created to figure this out. 
To queue up questions/issues to go over in the call i'll summarize what i believe are the high level ones here:Enabling/Disabling decryption on the source/target of export - Why is this needed at all? What are the consequences and risks to the source cluster (as that will be our current production instance in this case)The various routes that end up in javax.crypto.BadPaddingException errors (and if the KB article is even a reasonable workaround) (either immediately when the source still has encryption, or after restart when not)Warnings or errors from mission control after import (either in release with 7.27.6 or or in separate release with 7.25.6)General concern for validity of our helm release configuration (values) related to the advanced usage docs around bootstrapping or other configWhat may cause exports to be missing access/identity configuration?Speed of import - Seems too slow for our initial plan as the downtime would probably be unacceptable so will probably need to eventually setup repo replication as well. But would like to figure out if there are other things we can tune or debug to identify bottleneck.

Thanks for joining the call today,

During the call, we've discussed the following items


1. how to configure ldap based db urls for oracle db in artifactory 7.x

-> https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/how-to-configure-ldap-based-db-urls-for-oracle-db-in-artifactory-v7-x/

metadata:

database:

url: "go:<username>/<password>@testdb1"

env:

JF_METADATA_DATABASE_URL: go:<username>/<password>@testdb1


2. appd tool configuration should go in extraJavaOpts:

extraJavaOpts: -Xmx4g -Xss256k  -javaagent:xxx.jar  -Dappdynamics.agent.xxxx


3. LB should change Artifactory port from 8081 to 8082 as UI access should be done through 8082 only in 7.x

REST API still can be accessed through 8081 port as well as 8082.


4. You can delete the plugin (storageSummary.groovy) from configs table in DB.


Follow up call will be on Thursday 8:30 AM PDT (11:30 AM EDT)

Hi Babu,

Thank you for your patience and glad to hear the upgrade was sucessful. I checked internally and the service monitoring the frontend version is currently a known issue, however it is currently safe to ignore.

Regarding the "General tab". Are you able to test this on another browser? It seems other users have seen this behavior on Google Chrome browsers specifically. This should just be a UI issue.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Interesting that this threw the timeout error we have been seeing the last few days that is causing major production outage for us at the moment..

Should I submit another ticket for this specific issue or can we continue here? We really need to get this resolved as it is holding up many production builds..

Hi Jason,

You can try setting the "priority resolution" tag in the Advanced section of the repository settings to make sure the monitaur whl gets resolved from a specific repo rather than the public python one:

[cid:image001.png@01D7CA70.B6BE6D40]

As for the Xray download blocking:

Is it currently just affecting one specific repository or all repositories under a specific watch which includes a download blocking policy?

I would like to clarify that if we install directly from the remote endpoint, we see no issues, but if we try to install through the Artifactory remote repository pointing to this endpoint, we see issues.  Can you provide the command and output you see when hitting Artifactory?  Possibly hopping on a screen share to look further into this issue would be best.  Looking forward to hearing from you.

02s6900002PAOCQAA55006900003jajmAAAQ[#184142] Mission control Migration on Kubernetes with Artifactory 7.27Hi Yoga,

Thank you for reaching JFrog Support.

With regards to the use case, yes you will need to update the Artifactory values.yaml with the below parameters, perform a helm upgrade in order to install the insight.

Example:
mc:
enabled: true

Now, export the Mission control configuration on the old instance using the below REST API as a Json File
$ curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8082/mc/api/v1/system/backup/export -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

Afterwards, you will have to rename the export.json file to import.json and copy this file and the file backup.key to the Artifactory node inside the folder var/backup/mc.

Further, scale the Mission control stateful set to 0 in order to stop the old instance

Finally, Import the JSON file into Artifactory with the import API that reads the JSON file using the below REST API
curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8082/mc/api/v1/system/backup/import -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

I hope the above information will be helpful to you.

02s6900002PAODiAAP5006900003jaZoKAAU[#183938] Verizon Communications Inc. Jfrog supportHi Vineeth, Naveen, Amritanshu, and team,

Thank you for meeting with me again this morning. As I suspected, there was a single remaining Conan file which failed to be migrated, but we were able to complete the migration manually.

We started by looking into the Permission Denied error I emailed you about this morning. This error looks to have been a red herring, we found the checksum of the file in the error in the right "filestore" folder. As a precaution, we granted the Artifactory application Windows Administrator access during the next reboot.

Before we rebooted, we double checked the problem file mentioned in the artifactory-conan-v2-migration.log. We saw that indeed the "fm-conan:ennor/OmnitureFramework/3.69/stable" package hadn't been migrated, and moved the folder under a "/0/" directory like the other versions.

This worked when we did it manually. I am not sure why the automatic process failed on this single package at this time.

After moving this single file, we rebooted the application. Artifactory came online and the migration completed successfully pretty much right after. Conan builds and the API began working too.

Please let me know if there are any remaining questions or concerns about our actions today. I'm glad things look to be working now, and will check in if I don't hear back from you in a few days to make sure all is well.

Best regards,
Patrick Russell

We should not need two remote repositories.  We can try zapping the cache once more or clearing out this package from the cache.  From the initial request, it looks like we are hitting a virtual repository.  Do we see the same 304 if we hit the remote directly?

Hi Praharsh,

The reindex is an Xray endpoint so would be https://repo.clarivate.io/xray/api/v1/forceReindex.  Let me know if you continue to see issues.

02s6900002PAOBsAAP5006900003YgNRFAA3RE: [#183537] Errors when attaching bucket licenses to registered platform deployments and from bucket splits (redo)Hello,

Brian is currently not able to work on this, but regarding your last email, the licenses seem like they are propagated and everything is working correctly. The issue was that when you first selected "Attach License", it would pop up the error code that Brian sent earlier. After the error message popped up, everything seemed to work fine, but you would still see the error when you select "Attach License" to the next platform deployment. Like I said, it goes away and everything works afterwards, we were just concerned about the initial error.

Thanks,
Logan Highland

If it's a new issue separate from the PyPi remote issue, it'll get addressed faster by logging a new case as a critical.

I will continue testing this PyPi resolution issue and get back to you with any findings.

Hello Graeme,

The first error indicates possible race condition or error with replicating the actual artifacts:

2021-10-26 02:10:27,908 [http-nio-8081-exec-2] [ERROR] (o.a.e.UploadServiceImpl:321) - Failed to deploy properties to 'splunkcore-latest:manual-build/windows/intel/64/splunk/8.2.2110/8.2.2110/splunk-8.2.2110-ad20f3507e4e-windows-64.zip'

... 11 lines omitted ...
Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: insert or update on table "node_props" violates foreign key constraint "node_props_nodes_fk"


Artifactory is trying to replicate properties but the actual file is not there. This could be either the file was not yet replicated, replicated but deleted or is being replicating. We need to check other log messages related to "splunkcore-latest:manual-build/windows/intel/64/splunk/8.2.2110/8.2.2110/splunk-8.2.2110-ad20f3507e4e-windows-64.zip“

The second EntityTooLarge is still related to filestore. Have you removed the preSign settings and rolling restarted artifactory?

I can join your call at 1PM PST. Let me know if that works for you.

Thank you for your patience while I am working internally on the reported behavior.

Environment used:
Artifactory v7.27.6

1. Installed Artifactory v7.27.6 as per your environment.
2. Generated JAR Signing Keys using the below keytool command as mentioned in our wiki page here.

> keytool -keystore mystore2 -keypass password -storepass password -alias myalias2 -genkeypair -dname "cn=pavan2, ou=jfrog2, o=myorg2, S=KA2, c=IN2" -validity 10

Generated and deployed the two key-pairs as shown in the below screenshot:


3. Created Maven repositories using the Quick setup
4. Assigned a key-pair to the test-libs-release virtual repository as shown below, restarted the Artifactory application, and after which I see the key-pair value is the same.

Please note I have performed this replication by creating multiple maven repositories, setting a new key-pair even after that I was not able to replicate the reported behavior.

Repository configuration after the Artifactory restart:


Further, as I am unable to replicate the issue reported, could you please confirm the steps referred above?
If not, I would request you to share with us any missing steps.

Also, do share with us the Artifactory support bundle which helps to understand your environment better.

Thanks for sending in the logs. I am not seeing any errors, however, I do see that the request is slow.

20211026141127|58713|REQUEST|172.25.1.190|anonymous|GET|/api/pypi/cr-pypi-py3/simple/binstore/|HTTP/1.1|200|0

Does this issue only happen to the cr-pypi-py3 local repository? I noticed a note in your configuration, where a new pypi repo was created due to the large number of packages causing the slowness.

<localRepository>
            <key>cr-python3-2021</key>
            <type>pypi</type>
            <description>Created to be a younger sibling to pypi-cr-general-py3 which is too slow due to too many packages</description>

Are you able to test this on a smaller repository? I suspect the slowness is due to the large repo.

Lawrence Fung

Thanks for contacting JFrog Support.


In order to better understand the issue, please share with me the following:


1. Which openshift version you are using?

2. Is this an upgrade or new installation, if it's a new installation, please elaborate on how you deployed it.

3. The system.yaml and values.yaml

4. Is this a local Postgres installation or a cloud one, is it with the bundled Postgres or External one?

5. What is the deployment command?

6.  Is Artifactory up and running?

7.  What's the version of Artifactory?

8.  What's the latest version of Xray in OpenShift you can install?

As Xray 2.0.9 does not compatible with Artifactory 7.x

02s6900002PAOHfAAP5006900003jaiyFAAQRe: [#184109] XRAY not scanning newly added repoWill send you the xray one shortly.

These are part of watches as well as the indexed resources which I believe should get them scanned on its own?

I was able to resolve the problem yesterday haven’t checked to see yet if it reoccurred today.  We have 2 worker nodes and a dedicated DB VM for xray.  So 3 VMs involved for xray

I tried restarting the xray service on the second worker node.  This didn’t have any affect.  However, I realized that some of the processes owned by xray had not restarted.  So I shutdown the service again and manually killed the processes that didn’t die.

[root@fe2-xray-corp1-nvan log]# ps -ef|grep xray
xray      4219     1  0 Oct01 ?        00:00:23 /usr/lib64/erlang/erts-10.7.2/bin/epmd -daemon
xray      6640     1  1 Oct01 ?        06:05:07 /usr/lib64/erlang/erts-10.7.2/bin/beam.smp -W w -K true -A 128 -MBas ageffcbf -MHas ageffcbf -MBlmbcs 512 -MHlmbcs 512 -MMmcs 30 -P 1048576 -t 5000000 -stbt db -zdbbl 128000 -B i -- -root /usr/lib64/erlang -progname erl -- -home /home/xray -- -pa  -noshell -noinput -s rabbit boot -boot start_sasl -lager crash_log false -lager handlers [] -noshell -noinput --
xray      6802  6640  0 Oct01 ?        00:00:33 erl_child_setup 1048576
root      7486 19514  0 00:19 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto xray
xray      8067  6802  0 Oct01 ?        00:00:02 inet_gethost 4
xray      8070  8067  0 Oct01 ?        00:00:09 inet_gethost 4
[root@fe2-xray-corp1-nvan log]# kill 4219 6640


Then I started xray up again on that node and everything became  suddenly unstuck.  The load on both worker nodes shot up and everything started to get scanned.  In addition to the nuget-gallery that I added and realized wasn’t being scanned other repos were not scanning new artifacts.  We also cache docker hub and it only showed 60% of the artifacts scanned under indexed resources but this resolved as well after the service restart.

Xray was still providing data on artifacts that had already been scanned but it looked like no new artifacts were being scanned until the service restart on one of the worker nodes.

We are rolling out xray now to our users as a replacement for blackduck.  New artifacts silently not getting scanned is a real issue for us 😊

Will upload the xray support bundle in a few minutes but please let me know if you need anything else.  I really want to get to the bottom of what happened here.

Subject: [#184109] XRAY not scanning newly added repo

Hello Jason,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Have you added this repository to a Watch yet and created any Policies with which to scan it?

This is generally a necessary step to make sure that the full scanning process, including indexing can complete.

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray#ConfiguringXray-CreatingWatchesandPolicies

Additionally, it appears that the support bundle sent to this ticket was for Artifactory. Assuming that the above steps do not fix the issue, I will need to see a support bundle from Xray to look into this further.

Interesting that this threw the timeout error we have been seeing the last few days that is causing major production outage for us at the moment..

Should I submit another ticket for this specific issue or can we continue here? We really need to get this resolved as it is holding up many production builds..

Hi Jason,

You can try setting the "priority resolution" tag in the Advanced section of the repository settings to make sure the monitaur whl gets resolved from a specific repo rather than the public python one:

[cid:image001.png@01D7CA70.B6BE6D40]

As for the Xray download blocking:

Is it currently just affecting one specific repository or all repositories under a specific watch which includes a download blocking policy?

02s6900002PAOKUAA55006900003YcgiiAAB[#180576] Expensive queriesHi Hutson,

Thanks for the reply.

Regarding the IOPS and queue depth, I was referring to the DB instead of Artifactory. Is the DB on a VM or are you using RDS? There could be a correlation between high CPU and high disk usage, so I would recommend looking into if the disk may be a bottleneck during the issue.

Also, if you haven't already, you can try tuning Postgres settings for memory related metrics such as the below:

effective_cache_size ~ 50 to 75%
shared_buffers ~ 1/4 – 1/3 total system RAM
work_mem ~ 10MB

If you are seeing low memory usage, you can try to tune these so that Postgres will utilize more memory instead of CPU and IOPS. There is also this site which is helpful in tuning Postgres.

02s6900002PAOKjAAP5006900003MnMlCAAVRe: [#178334] Xray U Fixed version incorrectin addition to my post below, I have another question.
Issue 1You state: In general, during the daily sync Xray is performing impact analysis about the vulnerabilities and components that are retrieved from the global database. Therefore, new vulnerabilities and licenses of components are updated automatically, so new vulnerabilities are added and subtracted as per the database. There is no need to rescan build or artifact as this occurs automatically in background processes. -> to be clear......
If a build was scanned yesterday,then a database sync happens today,the scan results of that build can change if that build's open source dependencies values change in the new database sync.
is that what you are saying? and if that is true..... then do I need to rescan the build to see those different results or will those new scan results automatically be present in yesterdays build without any action on my part? and therefore previous build results will not reflect the past. only the present...... for ALL previous builds listed under the builds tab.....?

Thank you for joining the session with us.

Initially during the meeting we have gone through the environment setup and attaching the same below for reference:

Artifactory source - 7.21.12
MC - 4.7.10
Distribution - 2.9.3
Edge instance - 7.24.3

As a first step we have executed the Upload and Propagate GPG Signing Keys for Distribution REST API using the Nightingale REST Client and we could observe the below response  during the execution:

{
	  "report": {
	    "status": "PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_MISSION_CONTROL"
	  }
}

In order to ensure the status of all microservices, we ran the following cURL command [ curl -s http://localhost:8046/router/api/v1/topology/health ] and we were able to confirm all the microservices we showing as Online as expected.   As a next step, we tried executing the below REST API’s to upload and propagate individually, however, the keys are not being uploaded as expected. We were not able to view the keys via the JFrog Platform UI.

As agreed in the call, I have created a similar environment setup with the same versions and I’m unable to replicate the issue. I was able to upload the keys to the source instance and propagate the same to the edge node. Attaching the JSON request body for reference :

I further discussed this behavior with our internal teams and we suspect this “PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_MISSION_CONTROL” issue could be because of some issues with the Mission Control setup. Hence, I would request you to perform the clean restart of the Mission control setup and once all the microservices related to Mission control become online, then please execute the REST API with the same request body mentioned above and let us know the outcome of it.

In case if the issue still persists, we will hop on a follow-up session to troubleshoot the issue further. Looking forward to your feedback.

2. Is this Xray is fresh installation or an upgrade from 2.x ?

3. How about a Primary Xray node? is it up and runing?

4. Is this node for Secondary Xray node? then, you should put shared.rabbitMq.active.node.ip value

Hello Soly,
We found this issue only on a couple of react NPN packages.
In short, we have a policy with a list of allowed licenses and we trigger a violation if an artifact has an unknown license.
In this artifact, you can see that a violation was triggered because an "Unknown License", but the license is correctly discovered (MIT - and actually it is an allowed license):
We were able to temporarily sort this out using the "XRay / Ignore Rules" feature.
Let me know if you have any other questions.
Best regards.

Checking in Xray's backend I do see that Xray has been updated (the vulnerability database added this entry) to detect the malicious packages (0.7.29, 0.8.0, and 1.0.0) a few days after the issue was reported. Go ahead and perform an Xray database sync if you do not see Xray catching these packages.

If you have configured a Watch and Policy for the npm repository that your developers use Xray will detect this package with a High vulnerability. In the configured Policy you will have to have the block downloads option configured.
i.e.


If you want to manually block downloads of this package you can set exclude patterns for the package specifically.
i.e.


Let me know if you have any further questions

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Usually, we perform the upgrade once the new version<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+Release+Notes> gets released and this upgrade will be performed on weekends during non-traffic hours and it will be performed in batches i.e we upgrade only a few customers every weekend. A notification will be sent two weeks prior to the upgrade. If any actions are required from you, it will be available in the notification email. You can respond to the email or open a ticket with us if you would like to postpone the upgrades after receiving the notification.

I hope the provided information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any additional questions, I'll be glad to assist you.

02s6900002PAOLcAAP5006900003jaU3XAAU[#183783] Removing docker image from local repositoryHi Alexander,

Thank you for your patience while I was checking.

With regards to your query about the deletion of  _upload folders in docker images, it has been identified to be a known issue and it has been reported through an internal Jira RTMID-23288(Internal JIRA). Currently, the cleanup process of _uploads folder is supposed to happen on the basis of a cron which is currently expected to get triggered once in a day.

As the current default parameter value is working in seconds, as a workaround, I request you to amend the below attribute into the artifactory.system.properties file in order to make the cron to work as expected.

artifactory.docker.cleanup.uploadsTmpFolderJobMillis=86400

The file can be found under $JFROG_HOME/var/etc/artifactory and a restart of Artifactory is required for the configuration to take effect. Once the attribute is configured, perform a docker push, wait for 24 hours and let us know if the _uploads folder gets cleaned up. If it is a HA cluster please make sure to perform the changes on all the nodes.

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Roja R M

Hello Kalyan,

  In this case, can you share the logs from the artifactory instance? We should check what's in the log there. Just to confirm, Artifactory on host1 doesn't have any reverse proxy?

It seems to be a database issue again. Would it be possible to test this on a separate database? It seems we are seeing various different issues about database connectivity.

Caused by: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: The TCP/IP connection to the host sqlqp56, port 53656 has failed. Error: "connect timed out. Verify the connection properties. Make sure that an instance of SQL Server is running on the host and accepting TCP/IP connections at the port. Make sure that TCP connections to the port are not blocked by a firewall.".
	at com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException.makeFromDriverError(SQLServerException.java:234)

Usually, if the database connection is lost. Artifactory will crash.

02s6900002PAOAzAAP5006900003jafiiAAA[#184028] Artifactory metadata service failureHello John,

Thank you for allowing me some time.

I have reviewed the logs shared and could not notice considerable errors which could impact the service to break down. However, I have noticed the below error which looks like an indexing issue on that particular package. Usually, this happens due to either some bad characters in the name (for example, '+') or due to some corrupt metadata. As mentioned in the log message the package will be reindexed again.

2021-10-16T04:12:29.629Z [jfmd ] [ERROR] [d592080ef8041c1c] [common_handler.go:169         ] [main                ] - Error patching package with id: (docker://theiaide/theia): failed to add due to unexpected latest version value in DB. retry expected
Internal error while processing request,

If you still see the same issue then please add the below metadata service debug logger in system.yaml file, once the issue is reproduced then share with us the latest logs.

I look froward to your response.

I agree with the problematic layers being common across your images. For layer with sha starting with sha__48a84 an Artifact search shows it appearing in nearly 400 images:




Did this just recently start happening or has this been going for a while and you've been correcting it via rebuilding?

It looks like your attachments got scrubbed by a security policy so unfortunately I'm not able to see them.

The sha256 would be the sha value under the General tab for the manifest.json.  Looking forward to hearing from you with the results.

Thank you for your patience.

After testing on my end, I was not able to reproduce this issue. After creating my remote and virtual repos, running the apt-get update worked immediately. As recalculating the index resolved the issue, I would recommend doing so moving forward if the issue resurfaces.

The issue may be due to you having your cluster running different versions of artifactiry. Our documentation states that all nodes must run the same version. Please use the same version of artifactory on all of the nodes, and let me know if the issue persists.

02s6900002PAONEAA55006900003jaiw9AAA[#184104] Add 4th node with latest version to current clusterHi Pravin,

It's actually a bit unstable adding an upgraded node as a new node to a cluster, it can cause some issues and if a node needs to restart due to these issues it will fail to start up because of the DB changes made by the new node. In an HA cluster, all nodes need to be the same version. The only time this changes is when you are upgrading a cluster. You would upgrade one node (that already exists in the cluster), then the system notices this version change and locks itself into only allowing uploads and downloads, blocking all other config and DB changes. Some exceptions are thrown in the logs which is normal, and everything returns to normal functionality and logging once all the nodes are upgraded. When you add a new node to a cluster that is already upgraded, it can cause issues as it tries to set itself up by changing the DB and applying config but the cluster is getting locked at the same time and failures can occur.

What you should do here to add a 4th node is upgrade the three existing nodes first to 7.25.7, then add the fourth 7.25.7 node to the upgraded cluster. You can find the upgrade steps here https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Upgrading+Artifactory#UpgradingArtifactory-UpgradinganEnterpriseHACluster and the steps to add the new node afterwards here https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Installing+Artifactory#InstallingArtifactory-HAInstallation


To confirm, I had set up a 7.12.8 HA cluster and attempted to add a 7.25.7 node it a few times. Often the primary node would fail which would cause the cluster to become damaged or the new node would fail and not be able to join the cluster due to the changes. Once I performed the upgrade and then added the node it went smoothly.

  1.  I removed the inactive services before retrying the above GET commands and tests.

Unfortunately, upgrading the Edge node to 7.25.7 did not resolve the issue. I tried using the main URL (https://artifactory-test-edge.nml.com) but it failed with the usual incorrect join key message. When I tried http with credentials, it just says unable to add platform deployment. When I change to the http(s)://artifactory-test-edge-mke.nml.com, it just says unable to add. I performed all of these soon before submitting this email, so should be well within the 24hr support bundle window.

Thank you for your time,
Taylor Soderling

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#183487] Mission Control doesn't verify Artifactory Edge Node join key

Hi team,

Thank you for the meeting.
During the session we were not able to successfully add the edge node to the JPD.
The reason is unclear - We checked connectivity and also checked the circle of trust but we still couldn't add it and from the logs the issue was unclear.

We decided to take this offline, I will try to create a similar setup while in parallel you will upgrade Artifactory Edge to be in the same version as the main JPD.

In order to investigate this on my end I will appreciate it if you can share the following:

1. Artifactry main JPD, Edge node and MC versions.
2. Support Bundle from the main JPD, MC, and Support  Bundle from the Edge node.
3. Nginx configuration file of the Edge node.
4. The output of GET /router/api/v1/system/health output against the main JPD and the Edge.
5. During our session we saw a lot of inactive services which were not clear to me, can we try to remove them? I noticed slowness during one or two of our attempts to add the Edge node, and it is possible that all these inactive nodes may somehow impact it.

I will try to give you an update around tomorrow.

02s6900002PAONTAA55006900003YcgiiAABRe: [#180576] Expensive queries> Regarding the IOPS and queue depth, I was referring to the DB instead of Artifactory. Is the DB on a VM or are you using RDS? 
The DB is a PostgreSQL 10.x instance in AWS RDS.
I have attached a picture of the Write IOPS for our RDS database for past 3 hours. 12:00 is local time, so it matches the 17:00 in the SQL query graph, which is UTC time.
Again, the write operations look slightly elevated, but not significant enough to account for nearly a 10x increase in DB load.
I have also attached a picture of all our metrics for the RDS DB for past 3 hours.
It shows the CPU spikes, along with increses in DB connections and writes.

02s6900002PAONnAAP5006900003jaUnEAAU[#183826] Very slow respone time when using Production Artifactory Edge nodesHello Mehrdad,

The fact we see other users affected indicates that this is more likely related to the LDAP configuration.

We can try to use the following logger to further confirm the time it takes for each LDAP request. You can add it to the /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/etc/artifactory/logback.xml.

<appender name="ldap" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
  <File>${log.dir}/artifactory-ldap.log</File>

    <FileNamePattern>${log.dir.archived}/artifactory-ldap.%i.log.gz</FileNamePattern>
    <maxIndex>10</maxIndex>
  </rollingPolicy>
  <triggeringPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy">

You don't need to restart, but the log itself could be heavy, so you should remove it as soon as you see the LDAP issue again.

Thank you for your patience. I am currently actively working with our R&D teams about this. From our previous gather logs, it seems the access logs are not telling us much. From what I understand we are currently periodically restarting the services to avoid the crash. I am concerned that we might not be capturing access crashing in the logs.

Do you happen to have the access logs from September 7th? It looks like this issue originally happened on the 7th and I wanted to make sure we are not missing anything in the access logs. Please note that the access service log is found in the following directory.

/opt/jfrog/artifactory/access/logs/access.log

Subject: [#184109] XRAY not scanning newly added repo

Hello Jason,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Have you added this repository to a Watch yet and created any Policies with which to scan it?

This is generally a necessary step to make sure that the full scanning process, including indexing can complete.

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray#ConfiguringXray-CreatingWatchesandPolicies

Additionally, it appears that the support bundle sent to this ticket was for Artifactory. Assuming that the above steps do not fix the issue, I will need to see a support bundle from Xray to look into this further.

02s6900002PAOPPAA55006900003jaV10AAE[#183844] How to connect  a http request in reverse proxy  log to artifactory log. is there a sessionid or something that can be added in artifactory log , to easily map ?Hi Rajasekaran,

Thanks for getting back to me, good question.

You can't exactly correlate an Nginx request to a specific Artifactory log line. One of the major reasons why this is not possible is Artifactory's artifactory.log file does not make a log line for every single request. Instead, this log file tracks the application's internal actions and behaviors, which do not necessarily always correspond to a specific REST API action.

It is usually possible to correlate a reverse proxy access.log event to the Artifactory request.log. From there, I usually pull out the timestamp and search the artifactory.log for any events that happened within the application. There might be something, or there might not be, depending on the context of the investigation.

I had interpreted your original question to mean you wanted to track down a REST API action through the network. If you provided me with more details around what you are trying to accomplish, I could assist further. I look forward to your reply.

I don't anticipate any issues because the Dev and Preprod upgrades went so smoothly. However, this is our production environment that took us 3 attempts to upgrade from 6.17 to 7.5.5. That being a major release probably explains itself. ;)

02s6900002PAOPjAAP5006900003YcgiiAAB[#180576] Expensive queriesHi Hutson,

Thanks for the reply.

What is your DB disk rated for in terms of IOPS? Is it a general purpose SSD with 3k IOPS, and can you check if you may be running out of burst credits if applicable (there should be a graph for it like IOPS)?

Also, it seems that your free-able memory is constantly maxed out. You can try tuning the shared_buffers so more memory will be utilized.

Lastly, the problematic query took less than half a second in the explain analyze output. During the issue, is the query slower or is there just a lot of the same query? It would help to see if grabbing an explain analyze of the query during a high CPU period is possible.

There may be more examples like this, but we just happened to spot this. We noticed multiple high-severity XRAY issue IDs associated with v1.3.1 of the component "gav://com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream:1.3.1". However, when we go into the JFrog platform gui to find more information about this component, this version does not appear to be present in our repositories. We are not sure how to interpret this apparent discrepancy, but it lowers our confidence in the data we are getting from the XRay reporting feature.

At the equivalent URL for the production instance, I do see multiple licenses listed and an "Add License" link, but in the stage environment, I see no such "Add License" link.
The stage environment page shows:License Details
Licensed to:Optum (United Health Group IT)Valid Through:Nov 19, 2021License Type:Enterprise
License Key
For Artifactory Enterprise+ or Edge licenses, use the License Buckets pageEnter your license key below or drop a file<snipping what appears to be a single license key>

... with an enabled "Reset" button and a disabled "Save" button.
In short, how do I add an additional license to this environment (e.g. when we receive new licenses in a few weeks)? Thank you.
For what it's worth, the production environment page "looks like" an HA/cluster environment, e.g. it says "Note: Cluster nodes licenses status updates every 5 seconds (refresh status)" and has multiple columns (e.g. License Hash and Node URL) and rows, whereas the stage environment license page looks different, even though they both show "EnterpriseX license" in the bottom left corner.

02s6900002PAOQIAA55006900003YfFFCAA3[#182527] Upload failure in artifactoryHi Akshi,

To summarize our call today, we looked at the failures from your CLI upload. We first checked the artifactory-request.log and saw we were able to see each upload attempt, which would include a 404 (checking if the file exists) and then a 201. Looking at the CLI logs it showed a 404 failure on two files. When we looked for these files we saw they were .md5 files, which led me to believe this JIRA https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-25199 was the cause. Looking at the error message we confirmed we were getting the same error, and after running a few more tests we could see the issue was only happening to files with the .md5 extension. You can change the extension as a workaround (i.e. file.md5.buildname) so the upload succeeds, though you would have to change it back after to work with it if a project is hard coded to find that specific filename or parses files by their extension.

On my end, I'm going to go ahead and push this JIRA internally to see what the current status of it is.

02s6900002PAONyAAP5006900003YcvMSAAZ[#180903] Failed to GET to maven-public, Read timed outHello Eli,

The issue seems to be related to a temporary network issue on the upstream which resulted in the time outs from a specific region. Having said that we don't have insights on mulesoft environments. This is one of an occurrence where it seems like only the requests from a certain region were bring affected, hence changing the region will not be a good solution here. In such cases, a good test would be to bypass artifactory in your build and have the request reach out to the upstream directly assuming your host is in the same region as Artifactory. This will help narrow down any network issues on the upstream.

Please let me know.

Best regards,

One thing I noticed while researching this error message:

2021-10-25 11:50:35,039 [http-nio-8081-exec-1238] [WARN ] (o.a.a.n.r.r.e.NpmRemoteFetcher:66) - External dependency 'file:test/integration' rejected by the repository 'wds-npm' include patterns

Is that you might have a configuration out of sync issue.

In node, art-163460279412706. I am able to find the repository settings for wds-npm. But I am not seeing the settings in the config descriptor of other nodes.

Can you try to compare the artifactory.config.latest.xml under etc folder of all 3 nodes and see if they are different?

You should also try to visit each node by IP to see if you see different repo settings in UI.

02s6900002PAORzAAP5006900003MofpLAAR[#179068] Docker container upload and download issues.Hi Veronica,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.

On the call, we discussed the steps taken prior to today’s session:

Tested the docker push to the AWS Artifactory instance instead of the Azure Artifactory instance

Saw an improvement in upload speeds, but still saw issues with uploads over 10 minutes

Updated the default.conf file

Increased two different buffer settings, setting the timeout to 20 minutes, but still seeing issues with uploads to the afmc-jomsmvp-docker-readyfortest repository

Tested uploading the images with the JFrog CLI instead of curl

Did not see any improvements


As a next step, we tested an upload to a different repository on the Azure Artifactory instance.  When running the docker push artifact.dev.azure.cce.af.mil/afmc-jomsmvp-docker-readyforprod/geoserver:2.5.7-plus-650M command, we were able to reproduce the initial error with the 1ba10df725a5 layer.  We saw that the layer would push past the calculated 650 MB, retry, and then fail without errors.


This test highlighted two things:

This may not be a size issue since we saw the same behavior for a 650 MB layer and a 1.016 GB layer.
This may not be an Nginx timeout issue since the layer took 18 minutes to push before restarting, but there were no timeout errors after 20 minutes.

As we agreed upon during the session, you will schedule an internal session with your networking team to watch the traffic of the docker push command from end to end.  You will also upload a new support bundle and the default.conf file for me to review.

Kyle also confirmed that creating a Docker image in Aisle 5, uploading to Cloud 1 without scanning first, then uploading to Artifactory is an acceptable solution and would not be a violation of the network policy.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

02s6900002PAOS9AAP5006900003YfNb9AAFRe: [#182693] Upgrade JFrog 6.18.1 to 7.x versionHello Vinoth,

To confirm, you are seeing these issues after applying the upgrade to your production environment and not the test environment?

It would be best to schedule a remote session to take a closer look at why Artifactory is not starting up after the upgrade to 7.x. We can first investigate Artifactory not starting and take steps to revert Artifactory back to 6.18.1 if the startup issues can't be resolved quickly.

In the provided logs we noticed this error of interest:

...
Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "replication_errors" does not exist
...

The error is indicating that a table in the Postgres database is missing. We can take a closer look during the remote session to see if we can get more insights into that error and possible fixes for it.

If you are available for a session today, before 6PM EST, please let us know the best time and we will send a zoom link.

If not, please click here to book a session.

Before our remote session, can you retrieve the system.yaml configuration file from Artifactory and attach it to the case? That file will help us confirm some configuration items related to the database.

If you have any related questions or concerns, please let us know.

Subject: [#184109] XRAY not scanning newly added repo

Hello Jason,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Have you added this repository to a Watch yet and created any Policies with which to scan it?

This is generally a necessary step to make sure that the full scanning process, including indexing can complete.

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray#ConfiguringXray-CreatingWatchesandPolicies

Additionally, it appears that the support bundle sent to this ticket was for Artifactory. Assuming that the above steps do not fix the issue, I will need to see a support bundle from Xray to look into this further.

02s6900002PAOSdAAP5006900003jaigLAAQ[#184095] federated repository failing due to following errorHi Sangamesh,

Thanks for the reply, good question. I believe it's possible to convert back to a local repository, and after testing it on my side have drafted a procedure you can use while we investigate the problem.

First, the safest method of rolling back to local repositories is to create a new local repository, such as "scaligent-local", and then using the JFrog CLI to move the packages out of "scaligent" to "scaligent-local":

jfrog rt mv rpm-federated/ rpm-local-2/

[Info] Searching artifacts...
[Info] Found 1 artifact.
[Info] Preparing to move 1 artifact.
[Info] [Thread 2] Moving artifact: rpm-federated/7 to: rpm-local-2/

Sometimes this isn't desired, as you might have development teams which cannot change repository names easily. In that case, rolling back a Local -> Federated conversion involves the following process:

0] Click the "Copy/Paste" button in the upper right hand corner of the Artifactory -> Advanced -> Config Descriptor menu, this copies the entire Configuration Descriptor  to your clipboard. Please save a backup copy of the working configuration before proceeding.

1] Create a new, empty local repository called "scaligent-2" via the normal UI process, we will be changing the name in a later step

2] Go back to the Artifactory -> Advanced -> Config Descriptor menu and cut out the "<federatedRepository>" configuration section - Do not click save yet




3] Still in the Config Descriptor, navigate to the new "scaligent-2" <localRepository> XML block. Change the "scaligent-2" localRepository key to be "scaligent".

4] Click "Save", you should see a success message. If not, click the"Reset" and let me know.

Artifactory will map the artifacts from the Federated "scaligent" repository to this new local repository, essentially rolling it back to a local repository.

You can then proceed with setting up Push replications on the repository to push files to a remote URL. You can re-convert back to a Federated repository later, for all intents and purposes the repository type has changed back to a Local.

I'm still working with our dev team on the escalated issue, let me know if this conversion helps. One request I have from the developers is that we also need the same debug logs on the jfrog-colo instance, so they can see the specific printout logged by a debug line that should go "Failed handling event on message <Message>".

This log line is not in the jfrog-aws bundle we received this morning, it looks like the last federated message from jfrog-colo was received an hour before debug logging was turned on.

Patrick Russell

02s6900002PAOTCAA55006900003jaicJAAQ[#184093] Unable to pull external images from docker hubHello Felipe,

Thank you for your patience today as I reviewed the previous case and spoke with the previous case owner.
I was able to use this time to get brought up to speed on the work performed. This allowed me to form a hypothesis as to what may be causing this issue, and I was able to find a solution for my testing environment.

I took my initial testing of this issue to my locally hosted Artifactory, which is running a relatively recent version (7.23.X). I wanted to see if I could reproduce the behavior on my end at this version, but to my surprise when I tested pulling both of the images you listed, I was able to successfully pull both without errors. With this test completed, I spun up an Artifactory instance running the new version you're running now (6.23.28) to test the behavior.

In my older Artifactory version testing environment, I was able to successfully reproduce this exact same behavior. When I try to pull both of the images from the docker remote repository, the image with the tag 4.6.dev-0.20210726.56d0f711e downloads without any issues, but the image with the tag 4.6.dev-0.20210817.9c7bcd1d8 returns "not found: manifest unknown: The named manifest is not known to the registry".

From this point, I started to check our release notes to see what sort of docker changes there were between the 7.23.X version and your current 6.23.28 version. I found that in the Artifactory 7.11.7 Release Notes, we noted a JIRA(RTFACT-25912) that resolved an issue with the new way Docker Hub implemented HTTP which affected response headers. If you review the JIRA, you can see that there was supposed to be a fix for this issue in the 6.23.19 version release, as well as a multitude of other patches for different Artifactory versions.

I took some time to check the behavior on my Artifactory testing environment, so I spun up a 6.23.19 and a 7.11.7 Artifactory instance. When I tested these image downloads from the 6.23.19 instance, I reproduced the same behavior you're experiencing. When I tested these image downloads on the 7.11.7 instance, I was able to successfully pull both the images without any errors. I spun up one last instance to ensure that post 7.11.7 this issue does not re-surface. In the new instance (7.12.6) the issue was not present and both images pulled without any issues.

With the above information in mind, I recommend following one of the two below actions and testing the behavior:

Upgrade your current Artifactory version from 6.23.28 to 7.11.7 or later (We always recommend the latest version for the most stable version with the latest fixes). I fully expect this upgrade to resolve the issue you're facing.
If you have a testing environment, perform the previous upgrade and test the behavior.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the above information or recommended actions. If you need any assistance with the above recommendations, I would be happy to assist. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Andrew Grosskurth

Usually, as you mentioned when we try to resolve a package from Artifactory, the artifacts are searched or resolved first always from the local repository and then from remote repository cache, and then goes out to the remote repository. Kindly refer to this wiki for more insights on the artifact resolutions (search for search/resolution order) in the browser to get to the blog.

The search/resolution order when requesting artifacts from a virtual repository is always:

Local repositories
Remote repository caches
Remote repositories themselves.

The order within these categories is controlled by the order they are presented in the Selected Repositories list.

This list can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping it within the Selected Repositories list.

As you have already stated that the package "registration5-gz-semver2" is already available in NuGet local repository and while trying to resolve it is trying to resolve it from the NuGet remote repository instead of the NuGet local repository. Hence, I believe a screen-sharing session would be more helpful to understand and investigate the issue. Please let me know if we can meet over a screen-sharing session? If yes, please use the below link to schedule the session based on your availability.

02s6900002PAOTvAAP5006900003jajDeAAI[#184124] Artifactory returning 500 errors periodicallyHello Joseph,

Nice to meet you I will be assisting with this issue.

The 500 error can result from a variety of things. The most often cause of this is high resource usage/exhaustion.

Would you happen to have the Artifactory logs from this time period (of when the 500 error occurs and a restart is needed)? This will be needed to further troubleshoot this issue.
If you have the logs please go ahead and send them to me using the curl command: curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184124/"

I would also like to request a support bundle so that I may take a closer look at the configurations of Artifactory. A support bundle normally includes the logs so you have the logs within that time period you can configure it in the support bundle.
To generate a support bundle in Artifactory by going to the Administration tab -> Support Zone -> Create new support bundle

Thanks!

02s6900002PAOU0AAP5006900003jaoHjAAI[#184236] Xray server is stoping intermittentlyHi Jithin,

Thanks for contacting us.

I can see the below in the logs:
[2021/10/26 14:03:06 EDT] [EROR] (jfrog.com/xray/secure.(*SecureManager).ValidateToken:164) Failed to validate token: 'Error: Found invalid token, StatusCode: 401'

It looks like the token Xray uses to authenticate with Artifactory needs to be refreshed. Please try running the below:

POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/internal/binMgr/reconnect

{ "binMgrId":"art-demo", "binMgrUrl":"http://10.1.17.20:8081/artifactory", "username":"admin", "password":"password" }

Also, Xray 2.3.2 has long past its end of life . I would recommend upgrading to the latest 2.x, or even 3.x if possible (Xray 3.x requires Artifactory 7.x).

Best regards,
Matthew Wang

02s6900002PAOU5AAP5006900003MpYorAAFRe: [#179696] Issues on port 8046Hi Mari,
   I'll answer your email from the bottom up... the last two paragraphs are quite concerning because my interpretation of what you wrote would indicate that Artifactory is in fact not cloud-native as your docs indicate.  Running in an autoscaling group with automated health-checks will virtually guarantee non-graceful shutdowns of the product, else this architecture could not be supported.

I can guarantee that we are not setting any environment variables intentionally, nothing outside of the scripts we have provided is ever ran against these instances.

I am concerned that we are not making much progress to identify how to prevent this issue from happening but would propose that we update our scripts to not set the node-id in the system.yaml and let Artifactory use the hostname as you've indicated below.  This should hopefully prevent any conflicts between the system.yaml and the internal algorithm.

We do not have any preference on what is used for the node-id and hostname is probably more useful than the machine-id anyway.

Unless you have other suggestions/considerations, shall we move forward with this change?

Subject: [#179696] Issues on port 8046

CAUTION: This message originated externally, please use caution when clicking on links or opening attachments!

Hi Mike,

Regarding the node name in the UI, we have confirmed that the parameter which displays in the UI of the artifactory monitoring page is the node-id that is set in the system-yaml.

If the node-id is not set in the system-yaml it is calculated by the following:
node-id = echo -n "$(hostname)"
node-name = echo -n "$(hostname -s)"

The only possible way the value in system yaml gets replaced is if the environment variables are set manually.

JF_SHARED_NODE_ID
JF_SHARED_NODE_NAME

Please note that if the above env variables are set then it will always get precedence over system yaml value set. Looking through the scripts you had sent we didn't see that this was set, but we wanted to double check with you as this would explain the behavior.

Regarding access intermittently failing, we are currently focusing on this error:
[31m[WARN ][0m [573db38906bd84d9] [join_executor.go:192          ] [main                ] - Cluster join: Error during cluster join: Error response from service registry, status code: 409; message: Requested Router Join for nodeId: ec2fa5c68bbd773e56e902521cfc238d at: 10.233.10.86 conflicts (node id) with existing node: ServiceNodeImpl(serviceId=jffe@000, nodeId=ec2fa5c68bbd773e56e902521cfc238d, routerId=ec2fa5c68bbd773e56e902521cfc238d, state=UNHEALTHY, created=1633213628078, lastUpdated=1633213628078, version=null, revision=null, ip=10.233.10.17, endpoints=[EndpointImpl(port=8082, secure=false, paths=[/ui/(.*), /ui, /])]); Retrying...

After working with our r&d team we believe that this is the cause of the behavior. If a server is killed ungracefully - not allowing the server to unregister and, then started again immediately (before the old entry of the topology is considered stale) which would result in access not allowing his router to register which would prevent startup. A simple "workaround" is to wait after ungraceful shutdown before starting the server again.

This behavior would also explain the node.id name issue. The old entry isn't deleted because the shutdown wasn't graceful so the node didn't unregister from the topology, which would cause the node id to change as there cannot be two nodes with the same node id. To confirm this please provide us with the shutdown process of the unhealthy node and how long you are waiting before spinning up the new node after shutting the old node off.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Mari

I removed the theiaide/theia images from the docker-remote-cache repo. It looks like that's been removed from docker hub so hopefully that will resolve this particular error.

For the health check issue, I think that I should be using the /router/api/v1/system/health endpoint instead of /artifactory/api/system/ping. Is that the best endpoint to use for a health check?

Hello John,

Thank you for allowing me some time.

I have reviewed the logs shared and could not notice considerable errors which could impact the service to break down. However, I have noticed the below error which looks like an indexing issue on that particular package. Usually, this happens due to either some bad characters in the name (for example, '+') or due to some corrupt metadata. As mentioned in the log message the package will be reindexed again.

As of this morning, it looks like all the instances of the problem we were seeing have been corrected.


I've tried a few things to make it reoccur, but was not able to do so.


I think you can close this ticket for now; we will let you know if we see the issue again.


thanks,

Subject: Re: [#183097] Trailing '/' on pom url

This is *not* the only package where we have seen the problem.

We have seen it with

· the pom for "com.datastax.oss:java-driver-mapper-runtime:4.13.0"

o has since then started working

· the pom for "org.apache.cassandra:apache-cassandra:3.11.5"

o has since then started working

· the jar for "ch.qos.logback:logback-core:1.1.3"

o still broken

o go to https://tamr.jfrog.io/ui/native/central/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.1.3

o click on "logback-core-1.1.3.jar"

· the pom for "org.jamon:jamon-runtime:2.3.1"

o has since then started working

We don't know how to make it happen for a particular package; it just happens sometimes when we are pulling a new dependency (one that is not already cached in artifactory).



Here's how it looked for an instance of the problem, the jar for "ch.qos.logback:logback-core:1.1.3":


For us, this shows up at https://tamr.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/central%2Fch%2Fqos%2Flogback%2Flogback-core%2F1.1.3%2Flogback-core-1.1.3.jar

If you go to that page, you can see that the jar is not cached:





opening that "URL to file:" https://tamr.jfrog.io/artifactory/central/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.1.3/logback-core-1.1.3.jar

you get:





Looking at the parent dir, you see



clicking on the pom will download it successfully

but clicking on the jar...



note that the URL in the message has a trailing slash:

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ch/qos/logback/logback-core/1.1.3/logback-core-1.1.3.jar/



If we open that directly:



But if we remove the trailing "/" it works

We updated that setting on our remote repositories but are still getting errors. This does not appear to be every package that is being effected. When we most recently tried getting `org.jamon:jamon-runtime:2.3.1 we got the following error which had the same issue of adding a trialing / to the request

Can I ask you a few more questions?

Is there a way for support (behind the scenes) can modify usernames?  The user name field is greyed out for me so I cannot update it.
For instance.  Could we change all of our user names to be the user's email address?

Also if possible we'd love to have a quick meeting and discus SCIM  provisioning/importing?  I have the SCIM set up now and when I run the import from Okta it is only pulling in the last 20 users?

Yes, Robyn you are right. Whenever we enable LDAP / SAML SSO provider the option DisableBasicAuthenticationMethod will be shown in the UI Administration->Security->Settings->Disable Basic Authentication. Please validate this option once you enable external authentication provider in Artifactory. Let me know if you have any further questions.

Hi Ryan,

Thanks for performing all these tests, as they are very helpful in us continuing to troubleshoot and get to why you are receiving these 500 errors. Since going through both the reverse proxy and going directly to the instance gave the same error, let us add the NuGet Debug logger to the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/logback.xml:




<logger name="org.artifactory.addon.nuget">

<level value="debug"/>

</logger>

You can also use the following on the client:



#Example client debug command

nuget install -verbosity detailed <package>

We can then attempt to retrieve the twilio package and use the verbose detail given to see why the package is not being downloaded properly.

Thank you for allowing me sometime.

With regards to the query on open shift installation, please find the relevant links for downloading the installer files for both Artifactory versions.

version 7.15.4 → helm repo add jfrog-charts https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-charts      
                 helm install jfrog-charts/artifactory --version 11.9.3

version 6.20 →  helm repo add jfrog-charts https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-charts
                helm install jfrog-charts/artifactory --version 8.7.0

Alternatively, you may download the required Artifactory version from our download page which is available/accessible publicly. As you might be aware you may process the Artifactory  installation via openshift operators as advised in our wiki.

I would also recommend you to go through our github which helps in details with helm installation procedure of Artifactory.

I hope the above information helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions on this matter. Looking forward to hearing from you.

02s6900002PAOXJAA55006900003jabOPAAYRe: [#183972] Missing artifacts after DR migrationHi team 

The issue has been resolved 

It was a proxy issue 

after DR activity artifactory server couldn’t fetch from remote repositories. Updating the proxy setting for remote repositories solved the issue .

Users are able to download the artifacts from remote repositories

However , when ever we hit a "zap cache" for large repos's we are hitting timeout errors and the operation is not successful ( ends with a message of either lock not acquired in 120sec or jfrog artifactory is not reachable ) 

For small repo's " zap cache " works fine 


Thanks and Regards

02s6900002PAOXOAA55006900003jaRsjAAERe: [#183743] Upgrade artifactory to 7 from 6.22.0Thanks Sunny, another thing that's confusing me: 
We have a HA (Primary/Secondary) setup, Per the Docs below, we can do the upgrade with out downtime:https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Upgrading+Artifactory#UpgradingArtifactory-UpgradinganEnterpriseHAClusterbut step 2 of Upgrading the First Node is shut down all but one node. Can the upgrade be done live or do we need to shutdown the other node when we do the update?
Secondly, we are looking to 6.x to 7.x but I see in the 7.x to 7.x upgrade (i'm assuming we will be affected by it) a meta change https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Metadata+Migration+in+the+JFrog+Platformthe docs said: JFrog tested the migration process using a benchmark of Artifactory of 27k packages and 1.2M versions:Based on the benchmark above, the migration rate was 60k-67k versions per hour. The total migration using these specifications took between 18-22 hours.
Our artifactory shows, "Artifactory is happily serving 1,236,430 artifacts" I'm assuming a lot of these are remote cached but want to see if there's a way for us to estimate how long the upgrade will take ? 
Third, it looks like it's going from Active/Passive to Active/Active, From Artifactory 7.17.4, the HA cluster supports Cloud-Native compatibility, whereby all nodes are equal and the need to set primary and secondary nodes is no longer required.does that need to be changed as soon as the upgrade is done? or can we leave it as is to minizine change and change it later? Anything we need to be aware of for making the change (pro or con)?

02s6900002PAOXYAA55006900003jaVMdAAM[#183858] Java Security Update As Part Of Vul. Scan In ArtifactoryHi Kiran,
I thought I had searched the release notes for all three CVEs, but apparently omitted the last one. You are correct, CVE-2021-33037 was fixed in Artifactory version 7.27.3. You should also be able to upgrade Java on the host machine and point the application to it as a workaround for the other two CVEs until the packaged version is updated.

On a side note, the bug I opened for the vulnerabilities has already been linked to two other tickets, so there are certainly other clients reporting this issue. Even if there were not, I would expect a fix to be released in short order, as the timeframe for fixes for HIGH vulnerabilities is usually expected within 10 days. Please let me know if you have any further concerns. Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Best regards,

02s6900002PAOXnAAP5006900003jaoRbAAIRe: [#184243] Data migration to new Artifactory ServerHello,
We are in the process of migrating from our old Artifactory (7.7.3) to a newly deployed 7.25.7 instance. This particular Artifactory server is primarily for Docker Images. When doing the export, it appears the deduplication of Docker image layers isn't translating in the export, causing the export size to be many times larger.
Is this to be expected, and would the deduplication of layers be restored after importing the export into the new Artifactory server?
Or, is there something we should be doing differently for the export?
Please advise, thanks!
Patrick

To best answer your question in regards to what means if we upgrade to a higher version of Xray, Yes in the newer version of Xray they have included some of the larger DB  tables to the auto vacuum maintenance job to help with the spacing issue that you are seeing now.

With that said, do you wish to keep this case open until you have added the additional space needed to the DB to run the auto vacuum job or can we set it back to a resolved status?

Would you please let me know?


Thanks

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#184124] Artifactory returning 500 errors periodically

Hello Joseph,

Nice to meet you I will be assisting with this issue.

The 500 error can result from a variety of things. The most often cause of this is high resource usage/exhaustion.

Would you happen to have the Artifactory logs from this time period (of when the 500 error occurs and a restart is needed)? This will be needed to further troubleshoot this issue.
If you have the logs please go ahead and send them to me using the curl command: curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184124/"

I would also like to request a support bundle so that I may take a closer look at the configurations of Artifactory. A support bundle normally includes the logs so you have the logs within that time period you can configure it in the support bundle.
To generate a support bundle in Artifactory by going to the Administration tab -> Support Zone -> Create new support bundle

Thanks!

Best regards,
Derek Pang

Thank you for the reply and clarification. As Aritfactory utilizes a checksum-based storage system for validation, it does not natively perform jar-signing nor update appended signature files that have been uploaded to local repositories. Consequently, there is no set Time-To-Live value associated with uploaded signature files as well; the uploaded signature file is stored as initially deployed and not cached. I hope this does provide some clarity. Please let me know if you have additional questions regarding this as we will be happy to assist however possible.

02s6900002PAOZFAA55006900003YgMm5AAF[#183508] Issues with pypi remote smart repository not indexing packagesHello Jason,

For your issue with the Monitaur package:

I took a look at the logs and noticed that Artifactory is checking all the repositories for the 1.0.0 but in the .whl format and getting a 404 from all sources:

Oct 19, 2021 @ 19:49:59.260    2021-10-19T19:49:59.260Z|40585fb871ba971f|pypi-remote||HEAD|https://files.pythonhosted.org/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl|404|0|0|389

Oct 19, 2021 @ 19:49:45.355    2021-10-19T19:49:45.355Z|546fa2e3684c3db8|127.0.0.1|a097589|GET|/api/v1/ui/nativeBrowser/pgr-pypi/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl|404|57|-|24.135|Chrome|94.0.4606.81|Windows|10

Oct 19, 2021 @ 19:49:45.353    2021-10-19T19:49:45.353Z|546fa2e3684c3db8|170.218.219.22|a097589|GET|/api/nativeBrowser/pgr-pypi/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl|404|2|0|14|Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/94.0.4606.81 Safari/537.36

Oct 19, 2021 @ 19:49:45.352    2021-10-19T19:49:45.352Z|546fa2e3684c3db8|monitaur-remote|progressive|GET|https://monitaur.jfrog.io/artifactory/monitaur-pypi-local/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl/|404|0|0|9

It is then defaulting back to the latest version available in .whl which happens to be 0.27.0 on pypi.org

For the successful 1.0.0 downloads I see the filename of the package listed as monitaur-1.0.0.tar.gz

2021-10-26T12:52:38.468Z|6af09d1d24ee7311|monitaur-remote|progressive|HEAD|https://monitaur.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pypi/monitaur-pypi-local/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0.tar.gz|200|0|37118|14

So it doesn't look like the newer version of the package just exists as sources and pip is preferring the wheel.

If you download with "--no-binary" are you still getting 0.27.0?

e.g:

pip install monitaur --no-binary :all:

Thank you for remaining patient.

After reviewing the latest logs again, our senior engineers strongly believe that this due to a service in the path which is not Artifactory or NGINX (such as the ALB).

Since this ticket has opened, we have consistently seen that there are no direct errors associated with NGINX or Artifactory and that the connection is failing because an upstream client is closing the connection.

Since all of the suggested steps so far have not been able to prevent this closure from happening, we would like to know the following.

1. Our current understanding of the Stack is ALB->NGINX->Artifactory. Is there anything else between the ALB and NGINX or is there anything in front of the ALB?
2. Can you provide us the logs from the ALB from when this issue is triggered?

Hi John,

The logs are basically saying Sha256 checksums haven't been calculated for some files, and in the future we might make this a requirement which would force a migration to run. Currently you can run the migration by following the steps here https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Checksum-Based+Storage#Checksum-BasedStorage-MigratingtheDatabasetoIncludeSHA-256 which will get rid of the warnings. Other than that you can mostly ignore it, the Sha256 checksum does help out and allows you to perform some things like checksum search (using the sha256) but it is not necessary currently.

02s6900002PAObBAAX5006900003YgMsNAAVRe: [#183512] Artifactory randomly returns "blob unknown error" when pushing docker imageHi Sam,
Thank you for pointing out to the known bug and recommending the fix. We've tried to apply the config change, but that has made a docker client to fail even during authentication, returning a 404 error for commands like: "docker login artifactory.sdlc.ctl.gcp.db.com".We had to rollback the change.
That can be explained by the fact that with subdomain authentication should be done using for example "docker login dkr-public-local.artifactory.sdlc.ctl.gcp.db.com". So, from my understanding, we have to make few things before switching to subdomain method: 1 - create subdomains URLs for each docker repo in DNS2 - Issue SSL cert for either *.artifactory.sdlc.ctl.gcp.db.com(which is not allowed in our environment) or have cert configured with SANs for all docker repos or all virtual docker repos.3 - Repeat the steps for each new docker repositoryQuestion: How the subdomain method will impact other(non-docker) repository types? 
Alternatively if that setting is only for docker to work properly, can we configure additional listener in tomcat just for docker and allow clients connect to tomcat directly, while having repository path as http method?
Any idea of reconfiguring nginx to make it not to create a duplicates in the path as another approach? 
Could you also please point me to the log records that indicating the hit of this particular bug? I was trying to find it myself but couldn't.
Appreciate your help.

I understand the challenge involved when there is a complex deployment. I wanted to understand the problem better before recommending a path forward here.

In Artifactory 7.X a new column was introduced to the log files, the "trace ID" field is used to track events across different log files:

[artifactory-request.log]
Timestamp | Trace ID | Remote Address | Username | Request method | Request URL | Return Status | Request Content Length | Response Content Length | Request Duration | Request User Agent

[artifactory-service.log]
Timestamp (UTC) [Service Type] [Level] [Trace Id] [Class and Line Number] [Thread] - Message

This is what we control within JFrog applications' logging.

Do you have any suggestions about what could be added to Artifactory or our products to log an external tracking ID, such as one from an Nginx reverse proxy? I personally can't think of a good way to track an external request of this nature beyond the pattern matching technique I described earlier.

You can always create an account on our Public JIRA to fill out the details of a new feature. I would suggest including your use case and any details such as the reverse proxy type we need to add this compatibility for.

Subject: Re: [#182693] Upgrade JFrog 6.18.1 to 7.x version

Hello Vinoth,

To confirm, you are seeing these issues after applying the upgrade to your production environment and not the test environment?

It would be best to schedule a remote session to take a closer look at why Artifactory is not starting up after the upgrade to 7.x. We can first investigate Artifactory not starting and take steps to revert Artifactory back to 6.18.1 if the startup issues can't be resolved quickly.

In the provided logs we noticed this error of interest:



...

Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "replication_errors" does not exist

...
The error is indicating that a table in the Postgres database is missing. We can take a closer look during the remote session to see if we can get more insights into that error and possible fixes for it.

If you are available for a session today, before 6PM EST, please let us know the best time and we will send a zoom link.

If not, please click here<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jfrog.com/schedule-support-session/?fld3=5006900003YfNb9&fld7=rty&fld19=o__;!!D7qffA6_gfy2!FtjJakxJxPku-rIiVMxO8pwBxWZPftLwDTCYOKLQ_f4d5IVIuKL9OCDYjWbwZl5asg$> to book a session.

Before our remote session, can you retrieve the system.yaml configuration file from Artifactory and attach it to the case? That file will help us confirm some configuration items related to the database.

If you have any related questions or concerns, please let us know.

02s6900002PAOc9AAH5006900003jaixbAAA[#184108] JFROG Xray blocking low and medium vulnerabilitiesHello Nate,

Xray has undergone a number of updates with performance improvements and I would recommend an upgrade to the latest version of Xray if able.

The high CPU usage is just because Xray is very busy with indexing a lot of binaries when the copy to the Xray indexed repository was done. This is expected as it is a heavy load that Xray has to work through.

There is some tuning that can be done (reference for xray 2.X but still has relevant for 3.X).

Regarding the log collection (an Xray support bundle?) I am not certain what may be causing the issue. Could you attempt to generate another support bundle and if/when it fails go ahead and zip up the Xray log directory and send it to me?

You can then send me the file with the curl command: curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184108/"

02s6900002PAOcEAAX5006900003YgU4OAAV[#183668] Intermittent 403 errors when Buildkit attempts to publish Docker images to ArtifactoryHi Matthew,

Thanks for sending over the bundle and providing the information.  Looking into the logs, we do see a lot of these DENIED DOWNLOAD requests within the Artifactory access logs.  We have seen similar issues and would like to try updating a system property that could be blocking this token when attempting to authenticate.

We can set the artifactory.security.maxLoginBlockDelay=0 in the artifactory.system.properties.  This setting defaults to 5 seconds and blocks a user or token for a period of time when there are issues with authentication.  This will require a restart of the cluster, but should play a role in the issue we are seeing.  You can then monitor the instance to see if we see further 403s for the builds.  Looking forward to hearing from you with the results.

Apologies for any delay - I forgot about this over the weekend. Clint is out of office, but I will do my best to help out.

One of the Xray nodes in the cluster suddenly went down and I believe Clint restarted services, but the initial issue seemed to be that there was an artifact stuck on scanning that was failing Jenkins builds.

Are there logs through the console I can provide that would help find the root of the issue?

Having checked internally, these errors usually mean that there is a discrepancy with updates to the database and previous scan information. In the past, we have been able to resolve these issues by triggering the indexing process manually.

Can you try manually indexing the repository "pypi-dev" and then monitoring the logs and let me know if the error still appears? If it does not, repeat for all of the repositories shown in the log lines above, then click the same button for the incomplete repositories and let me know if they can scan.

Thanks for your Update.I have ran the suggested command as shown below.curl -u admin -XPOST https://xray.jacksonnational.com/api/v1/internal/binMgr/reconnect -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "binMgrId":"art-demo", "binMgrUrl":"https://artifactory.jacksonnational.com", "username":"admin", "password":"XXXXXXX" }'Enter host password for user 'admin': <<Here i have provided the password of my user and even to switch the user it will be same>>curl: (60) Peer's Certificate issuer is not recognized.More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle" of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file using the --cacert option.If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might not match the domain name in the URL).If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use the -k (or --insecure) option.
I have also tried with the command by using K as below is the result.curl -k admin -XPOST https://xray.jacksonnational.com/api/v1/internal/binMgr/reconnect -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "binMgrId":"art-demo", "binMgrUrl":"https://artifactory.jacksonnational.com", "username":"admin", "password":"XXXXXXX" }'curl: (6) Could not resolve host: admin; Name or service not known404 page not found

Thank you for meeting with us today.

We have initiated the meeting discussing the use case where the member node is not coming up after HA installation. We accessed primary node compatibility and everything looks good from the primary end. We further verified for any existing process for java/artifactory and performed a clean restart of the member node but the issue persists. We later moved to the log directory a warning about license key

2021-10-21T08:01:35.801Z [1;32m[jfrt ][0;39m [31m[WARN ][0;39m [325f1481853cda20] [o.a.r.f.LicenseRestFilter:74  ] [http-nio-8081-exec-8] - License is not installed

Based on the warning, we have to navigate to $JFROG_HOME/var/etc/artifactory and verify the license key and we have only one key available. Later we got to know that you have received only one key from our sales folks however HA requires two license keys.

As agreed over the meeting, we were in touch with your account owner to provide you with the additional key required. We have also provided you with steps to perform once you receive the other key.

I look forward to your feedback once you receive the second license key.

Hi Team,

I observe the same 404 error when clicking on the "Test" button, however I am still able to resolve the charts successfully.
Kindly reproduce the issue and share with me the following:

1. Helm client fetch/install command that shows the response sent to the client, with '--debug' flag for verbosity when pointing to the repository.
2. Support Bundle<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/J1e1Cn5XvYfQY5EMF9CeQW?domain=jfrog.com> from Artifactory, so I can see the complete logs and repository configurations.

You may upload your files using a cURL command to deploy them to our Artifactory SaaS instance:
curl -i -T {filename.ext} “https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184080/<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/Lh14Co2KwvSJ04nxCzp-pS?domain=supportlogs.jfrog.com>”

I missed an earlier email in filters so I'm replying now. The Janitor was
custom to our project and we are using the above policy where we did
observed "timestamp_type"*: *"*promoted**" *was retrieving the recent

older artifacts in 6.23.7 version. We fixed the issue with the option "
timestamp_type"*: *"*most_recent**" *and is working fine now. But we would
like to understand the behavior change with these configs in new
artifactory version. Due to this behavior our customers were impacted with
latest artifacts unavailability.

I'd like to update you that we observed the pipeline service in crashloop due to some builds that won’t be kicked off if head.repo field in the PR webhook event is null. This can happen if a git repository with open PRs got deleted and if buildOn.pullRequestClose is set to true in the corresponding gitRepo resource configuration.
We have an internal Jira related to this issue: PIPE-7175 and the ETA for a permanent fix is tomorrow. We deployed a workaround to make the pipeline service stable until the permanent fix is released, and in order to avoid this issue occurring again until tomorrow, I request you to check the above-mentioned condition (i.e some builds that won’t be kicked off if head.repo field in the PR webhook event is null. This can happen if a git repository with open PRs got deleted and if buildOn.pullRequestClose is set to true in the corresponding gitRepo resource configuration) which leads the pipeline service to crash.

Please let me know if you have any further questions, I'll be glad to assist you.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#183508] Issues with pypi remote smart repository not indexing packages

Hello Jason,

For your issue with the Monitaur package:

I took a look at the logs and noticed that Artifactory is checking all the repositories for the 1.0.0 but in the .whl format and getting a 404 from all sources:

Oct 19, 2021 @ 19:49:59.260    2021-10-19T19:49:59.260Z|40585fb871ba971f|pypi-remote||HEAD|https://files.pythonhosted.org/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl|404|0|0|389

Oct 19, 2021 @ 19:49:45.355    2021-10-19T19:49:45.355Z|546fa2e3684c3db8|127.0.0.1|a097589|GET|/api/v1/ui/nativeBrowser/pgr-pypi/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl|404|57|-|24.135|Chrome|94.0.4606.81|Windows|10

Oct 19, 2021 @ 19:49:45.353    2021-10-19T19:49:45.353Z|546fa2e3684c3db8|170.218.219.22|a097589|GET|/api/nativeBrowser/pgr-pypi/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl|404|2|0|14|Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/94.0.4606.81 Safari/537.36

Oct 19, 2021 @ 19:49:45.352    2021-10-19T19:49:45.352Z|546fa2e3684c3db8|monitaur-remote|progressive|GET|https://monitaur.jfrog.io/artifactory/monitaur-pypi-local/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl/|404|0|0|9

It is then defaulting back to the latest version available in .whl which happens to be 0.27.0 on pypi.org

For the successful 1.0.0 downloads I see the filename of the package listed as monitaur-1.0.0.tar.gz

2021-10-26T12:52:38.468Z|6af09d1d24ee7311|monitaur-remote|progressive|HEAD|https://monitaur.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pypi/monitaur-pypi-local/monitaur/1.0.0/monitaur-1.0.0.tar.gz|200|0|37118|14

So it doesn't look like the newer version of the package just exists as sources and pip is preferring the wheel.

If you download with "--no-binary" are you still getting 0.27.0?

e.g:

pip install monitaur --no-binary :all:

02s6900002PAOetAAH5006900003YfEt0AAF[#182516] Artifactory:  trying to reconcile metadata (db binaries / file objects)Hi Michael,

Thanks for waiting.

Can you run a diff of the entries in the binaries table and the files in your file store? Then, with the sha1 value of the binaries in the diff, we can run a checksum search to see what artifacts the extra binaries correspond with.

1. Get a list of binaries from Artifactory's database by querying sha1 values from "binaries" table

e.g. For MySQL:
a. SELECT sha1 FROM binaries Order By sha1 ASC;
b. save the output as a file

2. Get a list of binaries from Artifactory's filestore.

a. Go to Artifactory's filestore folder (e.g. ../ha-data/filestore/)
b. Run following command
find . -mindepth 2 -type f -printf '%f\n' | sort >> binaries-in-filestore.out

3. Find the differences between the results above using your favorite diff tool

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Dashboard"Insight does not consolidate data from all the JPDs and you cannot select the JPD from which you want to view the data. You must install Insight in each JPD and view trends for that individual JPD."
It says that Insight should be installed in each JPD, but doesn't clarify whether the JPD could be an edge node.Could you check which one is correct?Regards,Deyan

Thank you for joining today's meeting with me and Anand.

In our call, we were able to see that there was a problem logging in to the Xray UI as an Xray admin user.
We stopped and restarted Xray, and we also disabled Artifactory to act as the Authentication Provider.
Then we were able to login as Xray admin user to Xray UI using the non-local cached session.

In addition, we were able to create a new user and give it the admin privilege on the Xray UI by navigating to Admin->Permissions->Permission Name->Users->select the user to have the "Admin" privilege.
We were also able to see that we could login as the newly-created user that had a full admin access.

Since this issue is resolved, I will go ahead and close this ticket. If you have further questions regarding this issue, you can reopen this ticket by replying to this email thread. I'd be happy to assist you further.

Have a great rest of your day!

It looks like the Artifactory <-> Upstream connection works fine, but the Client <-> Artifactory connection is the one failing. This would be due to the Conan client not having the certificates for the https://artifactory-test.icp.infineon.com DNS. Depending on your certificate, you can use the following documentation https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/howtos/use_tls_certificates.html to add the certificates to the client.

02s6900002PAOgBAAX5006900003jajBnAAI[#184122] Working of AWS S3 V3 with eventual-less cachingHello Patel,

The S3V3 template also comes with eventual.

Here is the full settings when using that template

<config version="2">
<chain="cluster-s3-storage-v3">
<provider id="cache-fs-eventual-s3" type="cache-fs">
<provider id="sharding-cluster-eventual-s3" type="sharding-cluster">
<sub-provider id="eventual-cluster-s3" type="eventual-cluster">
<provider id="retry-s3" type="retry">
<provider id="s3-storage-v3" type="s3-storage-v3"/>
</provider>
</sub-provider>
<dynamic-provider id="remote-s3" type="remote"/>
</provider>
</provider>
</chain>

<provider id="cache-fs-eventual-s3" type="cache-fs">
<maxCacheSize>100000000000</maxCacheSize>
</provider>

<provider id="sharding-cluster-eventual-s3" type="sharding-cluster">
<redundancy>3</redundancy>
<lenientLimit>2</lenientLimit>
<property name="zones" value="local,remote"/>
</provider>

<provider id="eventual-cluster-s3" type="eventual-cluster">
<maxWorkers>10</maxWorkers>
<dispatcherInterval>1000</dispatcherInterval>
<checkPeriod>15000</checkPeriod>
<addStalePeriod>300000</addStalePeriod>
<zone>local</zone>
</provider>
<provider id="remote-s3" type="remote">
<checkPeriod>15000</checkPeriod>
<connectionTimeout>5000</connectionTimeout>
<socketTimeout>15000</socketTimeout>
<maxConnections>200</maxConnections>
<connectionRetry>2</connectionRetry>
<zone>remote</zone>
</provider>
<provider id="s3-storage-v3" type="s3-storage-v3">
<endpoint>s3.amazonaws.com</endpoint>;
<identity>[ENTER IDENTITY HERE]</identity>
<credential>[ENTER CREDENTIALS HERE]</credential>
<path>[ENTER PATH HERE]</path>
<bucketName>[ENTER BUCKET NAME HERE]</bucketName>
</provider>
</config>

The only way to disable eventual is to remove the eventual-cluster-s3 sub-provider in the template, but it means you will need to pass your own template.

You can deploy helm chart using the --dry-run option ( value.yaml looks good ). This will give you binarystore.xml settings in secret.


You can take that template and remove eventual-cluster-s3. After that, you can pass your own binarystore.xml settings in a secrect to overwrite default:

artifactory:
  persistence:
    customBinarystoreXmlSecret:

Thanks for the update. You might be able to investigate the issue in the Xray logs. Below are two logs to look into that might be helpful.

$JFROG_HOME/var/log/xray-server-service.log
$JFROG_HOME/var/log/xray-indexer-service.log

If there is nothing in the Xray logs, sometimes you may find issues in the Artifactory logs as Xray needs to download the files from Artifactory.

I took a look at the logs. I can see the error appear multiple times. Below is one of the errors with the time stamp.

2021-10-26T07:08:55.991Z [jfac ] [ERROR] [6af6e5c06e8fb44e] [.e.m.DefaultExceptionMapper:30] [7.0.0.1-8040-exec-54] - Request POST /access/v1/registry/join failed: Exception while trying to get the Register Key From config database
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Exception while trying to get the Register Key From config database

If you need to check. This is found in the access-service.log. Any other DB type can be used. If you need to reconfigure the DB you will need to modify $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/var/etc/system.yaml file.

02s6900002PAOhTAAX5006900003jagxZAAQRe: [#184050] Searching for Docker images in the Search bar returns no results even if the image is thereWe got tripped up on this because the image we were searching for had a prefix.  So, this image we were looking for was called “project/hello-world” and not just “hello-world”.

Searching for “hello-world” with Packages returned zero results.  Searching for “project/hello-world” or “*/hello-world” returned the correct results.

I guess you could this add this is as a search suggestion:

Feature Request:  Doing a simple search (without the ‘/’ character) for packages should project or sub-path.  Searching for “foo” should match “foo”, “project/foo”, “project/subproject/foo”, “foo/hello-world” etc.

Hello David,

For Docker images are you able to find them by using the "Packages" drop down option in the search?

The Artifact search will return individual package components which in the case of Docker images would be the image layers by checksum:

Artifact Search:
[cid:image001.png@01D7CA81.25D24C50]

Package Search:

[cid:image002.png@01D7CA81.25D24C50]

Please let me know if there's anything else I can clarify or assist with.

The listed Jira shows as Unresolved but only indicates affecting version

it's unresolved and no notes or indication of a projected ETA, I don't see
how it helps us much.

This missing behavior is not universal, only affect to some package sometimes. In the past, we reindexed conda repos to resolve the issue but this fix does not seem to be effective anymore. This behavior is observed in both Artifactory 6 and Artifactory 7# Download the environment.yml file from https://github.cloud.capitalone.com/raw/creditflow/legoland_creditflow/main/environments/limopclip_frozen.yml -o environment.yml that list all the dependencies for the conda package

conda install limopclip --name=test-env --channel=BACREDITFLOW-conda/main

# This will install limopclip-2021.08.18, which is NOT the latest release of the package.
# The latest release of the conda package is limopclip-2021.08.18-1. It's on Artifactory and is downloadable.

+ Eran, Adrian

Not having support for the “Projects and Roles” feature in the Jenkins Artifactory plugin???

Some drama here… I’m discovering this in the middle of a migration of a project from Artifactory v6 to Artifactory v7… I am a bit shocked…
We probably don’t see this in the same eyes… so I’m raising this for you: I think that Jfrog is not understanding the significance of this “small detail”. I’m afraid this is not going to make Jfrog’s product look good.
You manage to deliver amazing functionality and here because of a single simple parameter that is not implemented all the way, I am finding myself pulling my hair in the middle of a pipeline migration.
I promised my users that migrating to version 7 would be better for them in every sense. I really trust Jfrog’s product and its maturity. And I’m definitely not the first one jumping onto the version 7 wagon, so I’m totally not ready for this . This seems like an issue that should have been worked out long ago.
I played around with the projects and roles functionality of Artifactory version 7 and decided its good and worth a try.
I would never think that you did not cover this functionality from all the aspects.
Is there a warning somewhere? Saying that projects and roles don’t support uploading build info in case you are using the Jenkins Artifactory plugin???

Now this is going to cause many Jenkins jobs to fail because of failing to upload the build info, because the field for specifying the “project” name is not implemented.
I’m not familiar with the complexity of adding this parameter but it seems like a trivial optional parameter that you can add…

So for now I worked out the permission issue by adding a new permission target that allows the relevant generic user to read/upload/delete build info for all the repos.
Its not good because it allows the people in one project to delete builds of another... but I am going to have to allow this risk for now.
So the build info made it to the “artifactory-build-info” repo and the Jenkins job is successful.
BUT
All the work I put in setting up project roles is not covering me… now I need to do double provisioning… I need to add users into the project roles AND ALSO in to the workaround permission target so they can upload build info.
BUT
This is not enough…
Now I need to somehow MOVE the relevant build info entries from the artifactory-build-info repo into the antip-build-info repo (which is dedicated to the “antip” project).
So now I have to script some magic that will do this moving behind the scenes…
BUT
This is not the only project on the server… so I am going to run into this with other projects as well… this is not fun!
BUT
Even if I do manage to script that (in the middle of a migration???) still the link to the build info in the Jenkins job will be broken… because the build info was moved to a different repo … so perhaps I should just copy it… I don’t want to do all of that!!!
AND
Now I need to communicate this complexity to my users… to whom I promised a better platform…
This is not the end of the world but it is really un-expected at this time and seems to me to be a big miss on Jfrog’s part to ship this functionality as “production ready” but not to cover this functionality from end to end!

Supposing I tell my users to turn off the checkbox to “collect and upload build info” in their Jenkins jobs. What workaround can be implemented to cover that functionality outside the Jenkins Artifactory plugin?
some are maven jobs and some are Jenkins pipelines.
How I do we tell Jenkins to collect build info and upload it to the build info repository of the project? can you send me code that covers that?

I’m starting to think that its better for me to stop using projects and roles and revert to the old way of managing groups and permission targets. This takes me out of this issue in the fastest way and allows me to complete the migration without all this extra trouble … Do you agree?
Got more ideas?
Want to talk?

Please reply soon
Thanks
Amit

Hi Amit,

Thank you for the logs.

I missed your last email before I asked for the Support Bundle.

Regarding the use of Projects within the Jenkins Plugin, currently there’s no ETA on when this functionality will be implemented. Therefore, if you would like to continue to use the Jenkins plugin, the way to implement this now with Projects is via the following steps:

  1.  Publish the build normally to artifactory-build-info (the default repository where all build info has been stored until now).
  2.  Use the API to retrieve<https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fconfluence%2Fdisplay%2FJFROG%2FArtifactory%2BREST%2BAPI%23ArtifactoryRESTAPI-BuildInfo&data=04%7C01%7Camitron%40synamedia.com%7Cffd4593f54ab4993975708d99886dccc%7Cecdd899a33be4c3391e41f1144fc2f56%7C0%7C0%7C637708527260075733%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=O4cWnxBStHU2%2FwZwI7euyyWxt5sNMVbghUZusyI%2FTtk%3D&reserved=0> this build information and publish<https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fconfluence%2Fdisplay%2FJFROG%2FArtifactory%2BREST%2BAPI%23ArtifactoryRESTAPI-BuildUpload&data=04%7C01%7Camitron%40synamedia.com%7Cffd4593f54ab4993975708d99886dccc%7Cecdd899a33be4c3391e41f1144fc2f56%7C0%7C0%7C637708527260085696%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=Vo2yVxPvoMmXcvOVaHiKeiFW2O%2BY3b8oN9ME1dUIzbk%3D&reserved=0> it to the appropriate project’s build info

For clarity, artifactory-build-info is the default repository where all build information is published when a Project isn't specified. If a build is published to a Project, the build-info will be located in a repository with the following name: <project-key>-build-info.

Apologies for the delay in the response.

While parsing through the log files, we are unable to identify any suspicious entries such as hung/not processed builds. Hence I further investigated/discussed the use case internally. We suspect you might be hitting with a known reported bug referred to RTFACT-26230.

Also, please increase the log level to debug in Jenkins and perform builds published via Jenkins. In order to configure the below logger navigate to Jenkins -> Configure -> System Log and create a new log recorder Jfrog with logger org.jfrog.hudson.util.JenkinsBuildInfoLog with log level ALL .


Once the above debug loggers are applied, please reproduce the issue with two builds and share the logs from jenkins, Artifactory and Xray with the build names for further troubleshooting purposes.

You may upload them to our SaaS instance as a zip using the following cURL command:
curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/183218/"

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hello Joe,

It looks like you copied the "curl command" for the curl.

Could you try running the following (replacing the highlighted section)?

1.  During the Artifactory starting process, it will create a configuration into the empty DB.
So, before the first startup, there should be nothing in DB, so there should be no artifactory.config.latest.xml as well


2. If we install Artifactory but not startup yet, there should be no files in /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/etc/artifactory/
However,  we can put artifactory.config.import.xml in  /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/etc/artifactory/   before starting Artifactory,
make sure that we have to set artifactory user (chown artifactory:artifactory artifactory.config.import.xml) for artifactory.config.import.xml  file to be picked up by Artifactory.

The file will be renamed to artifactory.config.bootstrap.xml as a result after Artifactory starts up successfully.




The other option is to change the reverse proxy configuration, we can call this REST API  when Artifactory is up and running.

e.g

POST /api/system/configuration/webServer

{

"key" : "nginx",

"webServerType" : "NGINX",

"artifactoryAppContext" : "artifactory",

"publicAppContext" : "artifactory",

"serverName" : "jfrog.com",

"serverNameExpression" : "*.jfrog.com",

"artifactoryServerName" : "localhost",

"artifactoryPort" : 8081,

"sslCertificate" : "/etc/ssl/myKey.cert",

"sslKey" : "/etc/ssl/myKey.key",

"dockerReverseProxyMethod" : "SUBDOMAIN",

"useHttps" : true,

"useHttp" : true,

"sslPort" : 443,

"httpPort" : 76

}

Thank you for the update and thank you for sharing the requested files.
After further checking internally, the "jfrog-platform" chart doesn't support "artifactory-ha" chart format.
So, you won't need to add "primary" or "node" fields in the configuration.
You can pass the single "preStartCommand" as shown below.

artifactory:
  artifactory:
    # Note: For HA deployments, set replicaCount >1 (recommended 3)
    replicaCount: 2
    migration:
      enabled: true
    persistence:
      size: 200Gi
 preStartCommand: "mkdir -p /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/security/keys/trusted; curl -o /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/security/keys/trusted/aws-root-cert https://s3.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-ca-us-gov-west-1-2017-root.pem"

I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have further questions and I will be glad to assist you.

One more update today. We were able to verify that the azure blob storage piece is functional now by using a subset of the helm chart and using the internal database (excluding the connection to our external Postgres PaaS). We were able to get the UI up and running though it was not able give a storage amount other than NaN.

So in that context, can you see any issues with the external Postgres config given the posted error messages, logs, and helm chart configuration?

Thanks,
Eric

Subject: Re: [#182979] Artifactory-HA install fails on License import

Hello Ino,

I have an update. I quickly realized that I had forgotten to add "?sslmode=require" to the url which fixed the issue I posted about previously.

Now the install logs look fairly clean apart from one error which I've posted below. Now it is a bit more tricky to debug as I'm not sure which errors are relevant and which, if any, can be ignored.

As we can see, member nodes are stalled from starting:
$ kubectl get pods -n artifactory

artifactory-ha-artifactory-ha-primary-0   1/1     Running   0          3m3s

From helm describe pod on primary pod (kubectl describe pod artifactory-ha-artifactory-ha-primary-0 -n artifactory) :

Subject: Re: [#182979] Artifactory-HA install fails on License import

Hello Ino,

We are still getting the same error after modifying the URL. I am wondering if I need to add a specific line to copyOnEveryStartup for this to overwrite the old URL in the DB perhaps?

As you can see from the output of kubectl, this is still blocking the install:

$ kubectl get pods -n artifactory
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

artifactory-ha-artifactory-ha-primary-0   0/1     Running   0          5m22s

Thank you,

Subject: [#182979] Artifactory-HA install fails on License import

Hi Eric,

Thank you for the update.
From the configuration, I can see the URL is set to,


  url: jdbc:postgresql://opsniqcsartifactorypg.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/artifactory?user=artifactory@opsniqcsartifactorypg&password=REDACTED&sslmode=require

Can you please try removing the user name and the parameters after so it's left with,


  url: jdbc:postgresql://opsniqcsartifactorypg.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/artifactory

After making the change, please restart Artifactory and see if it helps. Please refer to the following link<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fconfluence%2Fdisplay%2FJFROG%2FPostgreSQL%23PostgreSQL-ConfiguringArtifactorytousePostgreSQL&data=04%7C01%7CEric.Smith%40o365.nielseniq.com%7C60dd1884e383488e8e7b08d9980292db%7C6ac7a1f45fb14153bb4f12d2020a1f7d%7C0%7C0%7C637707959103387649%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=TexLT7nvaMu0QEr1u6Z7%2BGVG1%2FxGbE2IqSR7r7gUrck%3D&reserved=0> for more information.

Thanks for the new logs.

In the logs we can see that ldap isn't the issue bc it authenticates pretty quickly:

I discussed your call with nir and he said you guys also set docker debug logs. Can you share those as well? Looking forward to hearing from you.

02s6900002PAOjkAAH5006900003YecveAAB[#182141] Migrating data from Artifactory 6.x to 7.xHello Jun,

These look like pods that were generated and brought down. These entries do get cleaned up automatically but it does take a while. (The nodes get set stale after 7 days from a successful heartbeat and there is an hourly cleanup job that removes the stale nodes.)

Checking internally not being able to remove the nodes from the UI appears to be a known issue (internal JIRA JFUI-7605 - "Unable to delete offline Artifactory nodes(7.27.3) from Service Status page"). This issue is still being reviewed and there is no ETA for this as of now.


If you wish to have the nodes get set stale faster (and get cleaned up faster) you can configure these configurations.

task:
  stale-admin-revoke:
    consider-stale-seconds: 604800 # the time period (seconds) since the last heartbeat was registered in the topology, so is considered stale, e.g. every 7 days


If you are interested in a lower setting I would recommend setting this to be 1 hour (3600). These configurations do not appear by default so you will have to add these to the file.

This change can be done by changing the access.config yml file
i.e.
# To change the configuration in an Access service, follow these instructions:
# 1. Find the value you want to update (the snippet I mentioned above)
# 2. Set the value in the access.config.latest.yml file under [$JFROG_HOME]/artifactory/var/etc/access
# 3. Change access.config.latest.yml to access.config.import.yml
# 4. Restart the Artifactory cluster (rolling restart)
Another example can be found in the wiki page: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Access+YAML+Configuration#AccessYAMLConfiguration-UploadingtheYAMLFile

02s6900002PAOlfAAH5006900003jabOPAAY[#183972] Missing artifacts after DR migrationHi Raghuvaran,

Glad to hear you were able to find the issue. Regarding the timeout from zapping the cache. Do you happen to notice any differences in proxy settings from your original instance and DR instance? For example, you can check the socket timeout setting for the remote repository.



Also, do you happen to know how long before it times out? The default timeout on Artifactory in the network settings is set to 15000 ms, however, it is possible the proxy could be timing out as well.

02s6900002PAOluAAH5006900003YfNb9AAF[#182693] Upgrade JFrog 6.18.1 to 7.x versionHi Vinoth,

Looking at the logs it looks like the replication_errors table was not created, which is strange as that was supposed to have been made in 6.6 and included in any version from then onwards. To fix this, we can run a DB backup and then start performing the failed migration with a quick

CREATE TABLE replication_errors
(
    error_id         BIGINT        NOT NULL,
    first_error_time BIGINT        NOT NULL,
    last_error_time  BIGINT        NOT NULL,
    error_count      SMALLINT      NOT NULL,
    error_message    VARCHAR(4000) NOT NULL,
    replication_key  VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL,
    task_time        BIGINT        NOT NULL,
    task_type        SMALLINT      NOT NULL,
    task_path        VARCHAR(1344) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT replication_errors_pk PRIMARY KEY (error_id)
);

in the Artifactory DB. Then we can restart Artifactory and see if it fails at any other step, and act accordingly.

Hi,


I keep losing access to the Jfrog support portal somehow, so I’m responding through email.

I must admit I’m a bit disappointed by this. We need better insight in the logs and performance metrics to support our teams.

We expected something more from an Enterprise grade product.

Hello Ricardo,

You have the correct understanding!

Your system will scale based on the CPU/Memory usage of your Artifactory instance. If you would like to run a load test on your instance, you can. However, please let us know before you do this in order for us to monitor your instance.

Hi,


So you mean to say that our instance scales indefinitely?

Are we allowed to run a load test on our own instance and it's API?

We need to have numbers to get an idea how far we can scale.

We are not using SumoLogic so that doesn't solve log access for us.

Ricardo.

02s6900002PAOlMAAX5006900003jaZr9AAE[#183940] Artifactory is no longer removing snapshotsHi Scott,

The cleanup should also clean the replicated artifacts as well. However, there could be a window where the artifacts are cleaned up and then replication occurs which gives us a window where there are more snapshots there than expected. Can you confirm that during some points the cleanup is working as expected? In addition, can you send a screenshot of the current contents of the repository as well as a screenshot of it in list view so we can see the dates as well? You can navigate there by clicking the native browser button as seen below:


Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Mari

02s6900002PAOmYAAX5006900003jajBYAAY[#184120] Artifactory support for S3 lifecycle rules and AWS GlacierHi Farhaan,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
Regarding your questions, please see the below,

I wanted to confirm the artifactory support for S3 life cycle rules like migrating the artifact to AWS Glacier (cold storage) if it's not downloaded in a specified period of time and putting it back to S3 if the user requests it at any point of time.

Yes, Artifactory supports migrating artifacts to Cold Storage instance like AWS Glacier. Once Cold Artifactory instance is set up, you can set up retention policies to archive unused artifacts or restore them on demand. Please see the below links for more information.

Cold Artifact Storage
Setting Up Cold Artifact Storage
Working with Cold Artifact Storage
Cold Artifact Storage REST API


Is there anything else we need to consider to achieve this from the stand point of making any changes to values.yaml?

You won't need to make any changes in the values.yaml file. You will deploy another Artifactory instance to be used as Cold Artifactory instance and go through the setup process here to connect the source Artifactory instance and the Cold Artifactory instance.


I hope this answers your questions. Please let me know if you have further questions about this case and I will be glad to assist you.

Best regards,
Ino Choi

Hi Vinoth,

Looking at the logs it looks like the replication_errors table was not created, which is strange as that was supposed to have been made in 6.6 and included in any version from then onwards. To fix this, we can run a DB backup and then start performing the failed migration with a quick



CREATE TABLE replication_errors

(

    error_id         BIGINT        NOT NULL,

    first_error_time BIGINT        NOT NULL,

    last_error_time  BIGINT        NOT NULL,

    error_count      SMALLINT      NOT NULL,

    error_message    VARCHAR(4000) NOT NULL,

    replication_key  VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL,

    task_time        BIGINT        NOT NULL,

    task_type        SMALLINT      NOT NULL,

    task_path        VARCHAR(1344) NOT NULL,

    CONSTRAINT replication_errors_pk PRIMARY KEY (error_id)

);
in the Artifactory DB. Then we can restart Artifactory and see if it fails at any other step, and act accordingly.


Best regards,

Hi Soly,


We already have all terraformed to create repositories. My question on more about how to set that priority resolution on those already created repos using that TF as could not see that option in below link


https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/artifactory/latest/docs/resources/artifactory_local_repository


We have like loads of local repositories (in 100s) so it not feasible to enable that option going manually.


Thanks

:EXTERNAL:

Hello Karan,

This can be turn on for both local and remote repositories. However depending on your usage and preference, you can enabled this option for Local repositories only if you prefer.

We do not have any documentation regarding Priority Resolution and TerraformB. However, you can use our rest API to create repositories.
You can find more information here Create Repository

Our sincere apologies for the confusion.

We have provided slightly misleading information. Binary Size is the true amount of storage occupied in the binary store and Artifact size is the storage occupied if there was no deduplication.

In this case, you are correct that the information in the Storage page is not correct. Will you be able to click refresh on the top right of the page?

Hi Soly,


“The binary size displayed is the storage occupied IF there was no deduplication. The artifact size is the true amount of storage occupied in the binarystore (the filesystem physically storing the artifacts).”


If this is the case, I wonder why the storage watermark used the binary size (which is hypothetical) and not the artifact size (which is real).




Artifact size never went above 1.5 GB throughout this month. The graph above from billing portal exactly reflected the binary size reported for each day. I hope the billing will be based on actual usage and not hypothetical usage.

Raman

Hello Raman,

The checksum based storage functions as a method of deduplication.

The binary size displayed is the storage occupied IF there was no deduplication. The artifact size is the true amount of storage occupied in the binarystore (the filesystem physically storing the artifacts).

So if you have a 100MB artifact in two repositories your binary size would show 200MB but since both repositories refer to the same artifact in the binarystore your artifact size is only 100MB.

Please feel free to let us know if there are any questions regarding this.

02s6900002PAOo0AAH5006900003K0jSwAAJ[#176157] Docker Image Push IssueHello Vikas,

Thank you for joining me on the call today.

On this call, we saw that the NGINX configuration was failing to load due to issues locating the correct certificates.

With this in mind, you will make sure on your end that the correct certificates can be saved to the node servers in a readable manner and will then update NGINX accordingly.

As an additional note, I mentioned that the upstream directives should be modified to include only one IP address (127.0.0.1) for localhost as we are changing the configuration node by node.

In that case, the artifactory upstream should be at port 8082 and the artifactory_direct should be at port 8082.

Once done, for each server, use nginx -T to make sure the configuration works and then either systemctl restart NGINX or systemctl reload NGINX to get NGINX running with the new configuration.

Let me know if you can access Docker over subdomains afterwards.

Best regards,
Anand Das

02s6900002PAOoKAAX5006900003YfNb9AAF[#182693] Upgrade JFrog 6.18.1 to 7.x versionHi Vinoth,

We want to create a backup in case we need to revert if there is a different issue down the line. If you have already made a backup before the upgrade attempt, then you should be fine on that end, otherwise it would need to follow this documentation https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/backup.html

For the table change, what the

Caused by: org.jfrog.converter.DbConverterRuntimeException: Failed to convert v60
	Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "replication_errors" does not exist

lines are saying is that the DB conversion step v60 failed. Artifactory goes through a bunch of steps to validate the DB, and then perform changes on an upgrade. These are all labeled v1 to v200+. Each one is a bundle of a few SQL queries to perform. In this case, the issue is that the replication_errors table doesn't exist so the checks on it can't be done. We are creating the table (as it should be there) so it can validate it exists and perform any edits to the table as we continue the migration. You would do this on the postgres container attached to Artifactory.

Subject: [#184223] artifactory upgrade to 7.27.3 proactive support case


Hi Raj,

Thank you for that detail. I'll assign this to an engineer who will be able to set up a session to discuss your upgrade plan with you in advance of your upgrade, as you request. To facilitate this process, please let me know some periods of availability for this meeting on your side, including the time zone. Then that engineer will set a meeting to discuss with you, and you'll then be able to approach your upgrade after this meeting with more confidence.

Best regards,

Thanks for keeping me posted. The access service.log seems to start on OCT 26th, I am not able to verify if this is the same issue from the past few days. You might be able to check the archived logs to see if these logs are saved.

The error is appearing in the $JFROG_HOME/var/log/access-service.log

Let me know if you have any questions.

Apologize for the delay in response.

While parsing through logs I could not identify any entries that could affect the Artifactory performance. Please advise if you are noticing any abnormal behaviour with Artifactory or frequent restarts. If yes, I would like to hop on a session with you to discuss the use case. Please provide your multiple available time slots along with timezone for scheduling the call as per mutual availability.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for quickly hopping on with me today. We added a necessary setting to the Push Replications menu, and replications kicked off after that.

You're planning on migrating away from Federated repositories to restore functionality while we investigate the issue further. I will keep you posted on my work with the Artifactory team, it'll be some time while we dig into the debug logs from today.

Since providing notifications prior to the upgrade depends on the subscription type and the upgrading of Artifactory is performed by the internal team, we don't have a public KB article regarding the upgrade process for SaaS instances.

It looks like artifactory is having issues adding the edge node to the instance which could be the cause of the behavior. Let's try to delete the edge node from the UI under monitoring --> service status --> re-adding the edge node.

Please let us know if you are still running into the same behavior after completing this. If so, please send updated logs. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Mari

Subject: [#183984] Urgent - remote docker repo not working

Hi Roman,

Thank you for the reply.

If I understand correctly, the dbank-public-docker-virtual is a virtual repository that contains several remote repositories, that one of which is the public-docker-microsoft-mcr-remote.
The public-docker-remote on the DMZ points to the public-docker-virtual that contains several repositories, such as the dbank-public-docker-virtual.

Please share with me the repositories under the dbank-public-docker-virtual and public-docker-virtual on the SaaS instance along with the Artifactory version of the DMZ instance as I want to work on creating a similar testing environment.

Below is the setting of the repositories from my test.
SaaS, docker-virtual contain a test-docker-local (local empty repository) and a remote docker-microsoft: [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vYY8u6fmx_EbQEEYgZRNopIIgoFDLTIjeHCMiR_rqfh2k7duMzxXJm_540q-1MHVqm-kdnsr6Hk-NXwO_GIN9tR3qRl2K5b_NYhUXW9fk8hXiigKAloFFdzfWZOlW_e1q8z1gPZ-=s1600]
docker-microsoft on SaaS was created with the default settings:
[https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/r_cwlIfLKaHNjYCKgq1AXvL_uxia3R7w3NREY2RkSTK8383JmHv2VrfGs35A8Ax5yFppPTX8gR20JX4QkjDHtdDDWrHS29x3UooTTh0wF-dKi_VOeIfng0kigmBlCDPP7iB_g1E8=s1600]

On-prem, remote repository docker-remote-saas that points to the docker-virtual repository on SaaS, was also created with the default configurations:
[https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1TL2O5KFHojIsi88sjCj4x8xYh1B6dK3Q4oItJa_5grpmU6aMBpZLHtBYB7Lb3UvOMPanM1CES2EojmLQaFGUldcq-wpgbd7t-X3tSeZPPF-Q1GZwECJSIQnoHGyhPz5J5PO4ECF=s1600]

[https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P0fqrzpHT8xWYZYiXTg92QmcK3D_od1__77138Hlygi2sVsprZd8G5tJs3A6Tzfy3sD4-60Vyuf7_DRYNZBHH5kp-1njch8945xsljq_euSgopCTL-BKp80yaZzui5S2RRalW92E=s1600]
In addition to the above, please test the following, configure the public-docker-remote on the DMZ directly to the public-docker-microsoft-mcr-remote repository and let me know if you were able to pull Docker images.

As for the Support Bundle, I would like to take a look at the artifactory.config.latest.xml file, artifactory-service.log, artifactory-request.log, and artifactory-access.log with the previously shared added logger from the time when the docker pull was executed, along with the docker login and pull commands and client output.

Looking forward to your update.

02s6900002PAOs2AAH5006900003YeceNAAR[#182124] Re: 502 Bad Gateway error in Artifactory during build !!Hi Megha,

Thanks for responding back to my last email, In troubleshooting this issue further could you provide me with a copy of the build logs that are failing along with the Artifactory logs so that I can help determine the timeline when if there is an issue with Artifactory or something else like DNS lookup or (if applicable) a reverse proxy.

You should be able to find the Artifactory logs in this location:

/opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/log/

I would recommend zipping the log folder then uploading the zip file to the following site:

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/182124/”

Lastly, I wanted to provide you with this link below, It has some insight on why the builds may be failing on Jenkins sites:

Here are some of the reasons why builds are receiving error message 502 bad gateway

The POM misses the declaration of the <repository> which hosts the artifact.
The repository you have configured requires authentication and Maven failed to provide the correct credentials to the server. In this case, make sure your ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml contains a <server> declaration whose <id> matches the <id> of the remote repository to use. See the Maven Settings Reference for more details.
The remote repository in question uses SSL and the JVM running Maven does not trust the certificate of the server.
There is a general network problem that prevents Maven from accessing any remote repository, e.g. a missing proxy configuration.
You have configured Maven to perform strict checksum validation and the files to download got corrupted.
Maven failed to save the files to your local repository, see LocalRepositoryNotAccessibleException for more details.

Would you please let me know your thoughts?



Thanks

I wanted to let you know that I had a chance to review the Xray log you provided me, and unfortunately, it did not have enough information in the file to help determine the issue of why your Xray pod keeps crashing.

With that being said, I wanted to know if you had any monitoring  (CPU, I/O, RAM, etc) established for the health of the Pod/Pods in your environment?

If you do have monitoring in place, could you provide me with some details on this particular pod you are using for this Xray instance?

Also, I wanted to ask if you could provide me with the following information:

1. custom-values.yaml file for the Xray pod

2. kubectl describe for the Xray pod       how to obtain the  -- kubectl describe pod <podname>

3.  kubectl get events

4.  Also inside the pod, I would need a copy of the log folder under the following location: JFROG_HOME/var/log




Would you please let me know if you need assistance in obtaining the following log request?

Thanks

02s6900002PAOsbAAH5006900003YfAIGAA3[#182400] Can't use Artifactory docker images with doker extention docker_buildkit.Hi Andrey,

So the images that are pushed directly work but the images that were replicated from the other (deprecated) instance fail? Are you able to create one of these images again and see if you can push it then pull it? Also if it's possible, would you be able to share one of these failing images with us to see if we can reproduce and find out more by debugging it on our end?

Currently it looks like the most likely issue is something in the images' metadata is causing an issue, possibly due to the replication or some sort of mismatch.

Thanks for the update.

If the checksum isn't in the filestore it means that the binary doesn't exist. It could have been deleted if the layer was shared by another image. Do you know if this could be a possibility based on your cleanup practices?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

We have sent a meeting invite for tomorrow. In this session, we will be able to gather more information regarding this issue.

From the information that you have provided, we have tried to replicate this issue that you are experiencing on our test system running the same version in the same region. However, we are unable to reproduce this issue.



Is the React package that you are using is a public package or is it a modified package?

Sincerely,

Subject: Re: [#184064] NPM XRay License Scanning
Hello Soly,
We found this issue only on a couple of react NPN packages.
In short, we have a policy with a list of allowed licenses and we trigger a violation if an artifact has an unknown license.
In this artifact, you can see that a violation was triggered because an "Unknown License", but the license is correctly discovered (MIT - and actually it is an allowed license):
We were able to temporarily sort this out using the "XRay / Ignore Rules" feature.
Let me know if you have any other questions.
Best regards.

And as we don't see much improvement with the setting, we added to fix NU1102 Errors at Artifactory side , it only fixed 10% of jobs comparing 2 months data before and after async thread changed.
#Artifactory async Thread Pool to Fix NU1102 errors.
artifactory.async.corePoolSize = 48
artifactory.async.poolMaxQueueSize = 1000000

For example: In first month if we have 50 failed jobs after adding above setting it reduced to 43

And need to follow up with above setting as we saying to utilize 6 cores out of 8 on Servers , will this be used only for Nuget resource functions on Artifactory ?

As we don't see much use in above setting ,  So, we would like to remove it and test how our internal re-try job handles and update on next steps.


Thanks,
-Naveen

02s6900002PAOu8AAH5006900003janQvAAI[#184200] Include/exclude pattern settings issue in Artifactory.Hi Jessie,

Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. In our session, we were able to resolve the issue described - encountering a "rejected the artifact due to its include/exclude pattern setting" error when attempting to upload artifacts with the symbol '~' at the end of the filename. In order to resolve this, we removed pattern '**/*~' from the artifactory.repo.includeExclude.globalExcludes property within the artifactory.system.properties file and then restarted Artifactory.  We tested and confirmed that we could now upload (and download) the files in question.

As for the error that we were seeing in the logs during our session, I do not believe that this error is a result of the change in system properties. The below error is received when Artifactory's Password Encryption Policy is set to 'Required' and there are users attempting to authenticate against Artifactory using plain text passwords.

Artifactory configured to accept only encrypted passwords but received a clear text password, getting the encrypted password can be done via the WebUI.

02s6900002PAOuIAAX5006900003Mo8AzAAJ[#178860] Inconsistent download from edge node with CLIHi Akshi,

Thank you for joining us on the call. We were able to work on the CLI command to get the download with all the parameters added and we could see that it worked on your end as well. We did some modifications like adding the double quotes to recover from the error we faced before and then we could see that the artifacts were getting downloaded correctly.

We then discussed the issue with the builds which give 404 errors intermittently. As you mentioned that this is a test build that can be triggered at will. We wanted to enable the below debug loggers to capture the AQL requests so that we can check the artifact which failed to download:

<logger name="org.artifactory.storage.db.aql">
<level value="trace"/>
</logger>


You can add the above logger to the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/etc/artifactory/logback.xml file on each node. No restart is needed. Once added please trigger the build at least two times or 3 three times so that we have multiple occurrences of the artifacts failing. We want to capture the requests for when an artifact fails to download or when it the same one succeeds in the next run. So please trigger the build 2 or 3 times and then share with us the below :

1. Build log which shows 404 and timestamp from the two or 3 builds.
2. Nginx logs from the time of the issue.
2. Support bundle from the edge node.

To create a new support bundle, in the Administration module, go to Support Zone, and click Create new support bundle. Then send us everything. You can send us your files using the following cURL command.

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/178860/"

Please let us know in the above regard and we look forward to hearing from you.

I was hoping to receive some help with setting up Federated Repos.
I have stepped through the following doco: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Access+Tokens#AccessTokens-EstablishingaCircleofTrust
In a group session, we setup circle of trust by copying the root ca from /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/etc/access/keys and paste into /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/etc/access/keys/trusted on the opposing nodes. 
We watched each certificate on each node be consumed by Artifactory and the certificate disappears from the trusted folder. After creating federates repos and when trying to add members to the federation we receive an error.
"PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target"
As we believe we have loaded valid root certificates with valid dates etc into the trusted folder, im wondering if its our config or something else stopping this from succeeding.
Thanks appreciate any assistanceDan

Did you add the following to the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/var/etc/artifactory/artifactory.system.properties file

artifactory.sha2.migration.job.enabled=true
artifactory.sha2.migration.job.queue.workers=5

and then restart? If so, then I've seen a rare occurrence before where the migration stayed disabled ("Path Checksum calculation job has been disabled") until we chose a node to run the migration on. Can you add the following

artifactory.sha2.migration.job.forceRunOnNodeId="<NODEID>"

and for <NODEID> change that to one of your nodes' IDs? You can find the node id in the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/var/etc/system.yaml, then restart and send me the startup logs so I can check if the properties were taken in properly.

As per your instruction, I have created the table in artifactory DB before that I have taken full DB backup. Then I have restarted the artifactory container after that I have checked the logs getting a lot of java exception errors. Check the artifactory-service.log file.
For table, please see the below ss.

Hi Vinoth,

We want to create a backup in case we need to revert if there is a different issue down the line. If you have already made a backup before the upgrade attempt, then you should be fine on that end, otherwise it would need to follow this documentation https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/backup.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/backup.html__;!!D7qffA6_gfy2!AF4BeNlermEjaPX1AG-t7zOc7IdNPQ8y1-oM2Jvdpy5hXgASt9oh7fgvNzjjmkUurg$>

For the table change, what the



        Caused by: org.jfrog.converter.DbConverterRuntimeException: Failed to convert v60

        Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "replication_errors" does not exist
lines are saying is that the DB conversion step v60 failed. Artifactory goes through a bunch of steps to validate the DB, and then perform changes on an upgrade. These are all labeled v1 to v200+. Each one is a bundle of a few SQL queries to perform. In this case, the issue is that the replication_errors table doesn't exist so the checks on it can't be done. We are creating the table (as it should be there) so it can validate it exists and perform any edits to the table as we continue the migration. You would do this on the postgres container attached to Artifactory.

Hello Ariful,

I'd like to check if an upgrade during late night hours of this Saturday or early morning this Sunday work for you, so that you can come in the Sunday morning to monitor the instance. This is because during weekends we perform the upgrades in Israel where our R&D team is also present.

We'll communicate back as soon as the upgrade is done, please let me know if that works for you.

02s6900002PAOvpAAH5006900003jaofOAAQRe: [#184252] Where can I find access tokens?I'm seeking for a way to gather all the access tokens that have been generated in our Artifactory primary server. Specifically interested in identifying those access tokens which have been created by an admin, which have no expiry set. 
The core reason for collecting these access tokens is for finding out their scope (see 182675). The scope will help me identify which groups are associated to such access tokens. 
Ultimately, we are wanting to cleanup our permission scheme by deleting groups that were imported from an LDAP integration, which we don't use anymore. We are deleting those groups in favor of creating groups which conform to a better and more meaningful naming convention that we can better manage. We would like to avoid "breaking" an access token if we delete a group for which it was scoped.
As an example, from the access backup I can pull information for an ephemeral user f5-solis. Is there enough information below that can shed light to the scope of the access token? {   "id" : "aec71e8f-53d7-49e3-aff5-019325242a62",   "subject" : "jfrt@01c9j5c7r3wpkx029x5r310ebf/users/f5-solis",   "owner" : "jfrt@01c9j5c7r3wpkx029x5r310ebf/users/admin",   "created" : 1617908198722,   "scope" : "HASHED:f85c475001ddf476da0fec6e86d278759efd522e4d4ccb5520122923aedc2e3b",   "type" : "generic",   "username" : "f5-solis",   "expiry" : 0,   "refreshToken" : null }

Thank you for the update.
As we see many messages in the analysis and impactAnalysis queue, it looks like it's causing Analysis service to go into an unhealthy state.

Please try the following steps,

Please check that both Xray and Postgres Database meet the system requirements.

Xray and DB: 6 CPU
Xray and DB: 24 GB
Xray and DB: 500 GB (SSD, 3000 IOPS)

Please try increasing the "analysis" and "impactAnalysis" workers size by running the below REST API call.

curl -uadmin -XPUT <JFROG_URL>/xray/api/v1/configuration/workersCount

{
    "index": {
        "new_content": 8,
        "existing_content": 4
    },
    "persist": {
        "new_content": 8,
        "existing_content": 4
    },
 "analysis": { "new_content": 16, "existing_content": 8
    },
    "alert": {
        "new_content": 8,
        "existing_content": 4
    },
 "impact_analysis": { "new_content": 8
    },
    "notification": {
        "new_content": 8
    }
}

You would need to restart Xray to apply the change. Then please check the RabbitMQ queue and share the status.

Take thread dumps by running the below command (3 times 10 seconds apart):
curl "http://localhost:7000/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2" > "analysis.dump.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).td"
Please upload the Xray logs and thread dumps to our SaaS account using the following command,

curl -i -T [filename.ext] "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/183719/"


Looking forward to hearing from you.

We have like loads of local repositories (in 100s) so it not feasible to enable that option going manually.

as per this ticket https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-26194
_uploads folder is a temporary folder and the files in that folder will be marked for deletion. I assume that is the reason why the _upload folder is not copied to target.
could you please confirm the same?
Thanks,Srinivas

Hi Ken,



Thanks for getting back to me with the logs, with that said can you please confirm if you have copied  the ca certificate from each server and placed it in the following location:

/opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/access/keys/trusted



Each server should have a CA certificate either a self-signed cert or an imported cert from a third-party vendor that has been registered in that environment.

Those certs need to be copied from each server and placed in the trusted folder to allow for the circle of trust to exist.



Would you please let me know?


Thanks

02s6900002PAOxlAAH5006900003jaiXlAAI[#184091] Java SE vulnerabilitiesHello Claudio,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Of those reported CVEs 2 have recently been resolved for newer versions of Artifactory, 2 are part of a recent internal ticket created with the Artifactory developers, and 2 will need an internal ticket to be created as well. For the resolved CVEs, CVE-2021-2161 and CVE-2021-2369, the Artifactory installers were updated to use 11.0.11 instead of 11.0.10, but it looks like 11.0.11 has a few CVEs as well.

Artifactory allows you to specify the Java 11 distribution it will use so the vulnerability can be resolved locally.

To resolve this issue locally:

Install a new version of JDK 11 distribution on the artifactory server.
Add a “javaHome” variable that points to the new installation to the “shared” area of the system.yaml file .

The example below specifies the path to the default JDK 11 distro that comes bundled with Artifactory. You can change the path to the location of another JDK 11 distro:

shared:
  javaHome: "JFROG_HOME/artifactory/app/third-party/java"


We will open a new ticket with the Artifactory developers to have them investigate the CVEs related to JDK 11.0.11. To help us with this, can you generate a Support Bundle and attach it to the case?

If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know.

Best regards,
Kemar Gooden

Subject: Re: [#183836] GoLang repositories
Hi, thanks for reaching out. We are still having issues, but have at least narrowed down the problem to be reproducible, within our environment.
We have an issue where we set the GOPROXY to point to our virtual repository named "stash-core-go" and have no value (unset) GOPRIVATE.
The steps to reproduce are
unset GOPRIVATE
export GOPROXY="https://stash-core-local-dev:TOKEN@stash.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/go/stash-core-go"
rm go.sum
go clean -modcache
# edit go.mod: remove everything but module & go 1.16
go mod tidy
The above forces a re-downloading of dependencies. This results in 404 errors trying to access our own (stash-core) modules. For example:
github.com/stash-core/database-tools/pkg/transaction: cannot find module providing package github.com/stash-core/database-tools/pkg/transaction: module github.com/stash-core/database-tools/pkg/transaction: reading https://stash-core-local-dev:xxxxx@stash.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/go/stash-core-go/github.com/stash-core/database-tools/pkg/transaction/@v/list: 404 Not Found
"stash-core" is private, so you won't be able to see it, however this path does exist: https://github.com/stash-core/database-tools/tree/main/pkg/transaction and the "stash-core-github-remote" Repository in Artifactory is configured with a username/token that has access to the repository.
The current workaround is to set GOPRIVATE to "github.com/stash-core", but this defeats the purpose of using Artifactory. We'd like all downloads to go through Artifactory.
Appreciate any insight you can provide.

Thank you for contacting Jfrog Support!

We understand that you are currently experiencing issue with Go remote repository. In order for us to further investigate this issue, we would like to collect more information regarding your environment.

From the logs that we have on our side, we can see that Artifactory is unable to find the file in Github and got a 404 error.

I see, it looks like there are multiple conversion steps that were considered skipped so they would cause us issues. These are likely in the previous steps. Please get the output of the following query and send me that



Select * from schema_change_log

Hi James,

Yes, the task failed due to pipelines and the internal team has manually validated the task. The status should be moved from "in progress" now.
Please let me know if you still see the "in progress" status.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Justin,

We checked through the internal config and it looks like we cannot delete it from that end either, it's a DB only value. Can you send us which integrations you want us to delete and the error message you get when trying to delete them, and I'll check on the DB end how we can delete them?

02s6900002PAP0VAAX5006900003YgTiiAAF[#183648] Unable to resolve the latest version from [RELEASE] npm tag in curl commandHi Ben,

Thanks for performing all these commands and sending the logs. They are helpful in determining why the Retrieve Latest Artifact REST API call was not pulling the desired npm package. What I found was that attempting to retrieve the latest version of the package by

curl -uartifactory-demouser "https://artifactory.cloud.capitalone.com:443/artifactory/npm-internalfacing/adler-32/-/adler-[RELEASE].tgz" -X GET --output adler-latest-release.version.tgz


Is failing because “adler-[RELEASE]” needs to be “adler-32-[RELEASE]”. We can see this by going to Artifactory’s Administration portal -> Repositories -> Layouts, filtering for npm, and using the Test Artifact Path Resolution.


The above shows that Artifactory detects the version number to be 1.2.0 and the package module name to be adler-32. Therefore, the Retrieve Latest Artifacts REST API call should be successful if performed like this:

curl -uartifactory-demouser "https://artifactory.cloud.capitalone.com:443/artifactory/npm-internalfacing/adler-32/-/adler-32-[RELEASE].tgz" -X GET --output adler-latest-release.version.tgz


Please perform this and let me know if it is successful.

Thanks for the update. It might be helpful to turn on the LDAP debugger logger to see the average response time for your LDAP request. The issue may also be related to networks, which is why it's intermittent. Regardless, it's best to double-check your LDAP settings. Feel free to share the settings with us, or let us know any feedback from your LDAP teams regarding what could be changed.

I will leave the ticket open for a while to see if you see any such reports again.

That's strange, that is a required table and it shouldn't have been working without it. The contents would look like

v26 v26_node_props_index 1633122834146 1633122834146 SKIPPED SEQ_SYNC 6.5.0-m001 6.5.0-m001
v27 v27_replication_errors 1633122834150 1633122834150 SKIPPED SEQ_SYNC 6.6.0-m001 6.6.0-m001
v28 Create index `replication_errors_rep_key_idx` for `replication_errors` on `replication_key` field. 1633122834154 1633122834154 SKIPPED SEQ_SYNC 6.6.0-m001 6.6.0-m001

and we would change some of the SKIPPED steps to FAILED so they get rerun. They were skipped because v27, which creates the replication_errors table, was skipped at some point. If you add a semicolon (;) to the end of the query does it still fail? Some versions of SQL require the semicolon to enact SQL statements.

If it still fails, what we likely need to do is revert to the old version and create a new instance that's upgraded. Then we can run an export/import from the older server to the newer one and remove the old one.

02s6900002PAP0zAAH5006900003MpYorAAF[#179696] Issues on port 8046Hi Michael,

I believe there is some miscommunication on the definition of "graceful shutdown". From your response, " Running in an autoscaling group with automated health-checks will virtually guarantee non-graceful shutdowns of the product, else this architecture could not be supported.", it seems like your understanding is that we have suggested a graceful shutdown of the entire instance, while we were referencing a graceful shutdown of the one problematic node. If there was in fact a misunderstanding there please let us know:
-  how long you are waiting during the automation process during the kill time of the unhealthy node and the spin up of the new node
- what your process of killing the unhealthy node is
As mentioned before not allowing the server to unregister and, then started again immediately (before the old entry of the topology is considered stale) which would result in access not allowing the router to register which would prevent startup.

If you were correct with your understanding regarding the graceful shutdown on the node node, please confirm this with us. In addition, I would be more than willing to setup a call tomorrow to get full clarity on this.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Mari

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to your second query, the dependency rewrite feature was made to limit the locations from which NPM could fetch and catch dependencies through Artifactory.

Please read the full section here to get an idea of why the feature was implemented and what the drawbacks might be to not using it.

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/npm+Registry#npmRegistry-AutomaticallyRewritingExternalDependencies

Regarding your first query, I will need to do some further investigation of your environment to determine why this might be the case.

Please reproduce the issue once using a verbose npm install, then send me the full output of the npm install command as well as a support bundle using the command below.

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184129/“


Looking forward to your response.

There are not many other configurations that we can try but I was discussing this internally and one suggestion would be to remove the "User DN Patter" and place it instead in the searchBase (i.e. ou=people, ou=entsys, dc=ups.com).

The request that gets sent to the Active Directory differs slightly from this and may help with the "LDAP: error code 19 - Constraint Violation".

Yeah, the xsd schema in DR instance is 3.0.5 and it's higher in prod as the error referring to:  'http://artifactory.jfrog.org/xsd/3.0.5' implies. One thing you can try is look for that xsd version string in the export xml - export.security.1555111608802.xml, change it to 3.0.5 and see if it goes through. Otherwise, you'll need a backup from prior to upgrade.

(403) Reason: "username or password not allowed"  Is this info coming from old config? If so, so we need this to be updated in system.yaml?

Subject: [#182693] Upgrade JFrog 6.18.1 to 7.x version

Hi Vinoth,

That's strange, that is a required table and it shouldn't have been working without it. The contents would look like



v26 v26_node_props_index 1633122834146 1633122834146 SKIPPED SEQ_SYNC 6.5.0-m001 6.5.0-m001

v27 v27_replication_errors 1633122834150 1633122834150 SKIPPED SEQ_SYNC 6.6.0-m001 6.6.0-m001

v28 Create index `replication_errors_rep_key_idx` for `replication_errors` on `replication_key` field. 1633122834154 1633122834154 SKIPPED SEQ_SYNC 6.6.0-m001 6.6.0-m001
and we would change some of the SKIPPED steps to FAILED so they get rerun. They were skipped because v27, which creates the replication_errors table, was skipped at some point. If you add a semicolon (;) to the end of the query does it still fail? Some versions of SQL require the semicolon to enact SQL statements.

If it still fails, what we likely need to do is revert to the old version and create a new instance that's upgraded. Then we can run an export/import from the older server to the newer one and remove the old one.

An event that makes a change to the Artifactory configuration will reload the active configuration and be logged in the artifactory-service.log with a message stating the application context has been reloaded



With this we can see a spike in these messages last Monday (1200UTC-2359UTC) but the reload messages themselves would not indicate the type of change performed at that time.

I've also checked our backend and confirmed we did not have any activity affecting your instance at that time.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist with.

Hi Raul,

Kindly note that the Watch will scan artifacts in the configured resources when a scan-triggering event happens, such as rescan following the database sync, which will trigger the actions configured in the Policies in the relevant Watches if any new violations arise.

02s6900002PAP4IAAX5006900003jaoiwAAA[#184256] Artifactory not syncing after root disk was fullHi Jamie,

It looks like the issue was with the properties being replicated. Can you check if you can access this URL so that we can confirm the properties exist: https://repo.kub1.alprgagq.vzwops.com:443/artifactory/ws_platform_docker//f5/aspenmesh/releases/controlplane-1.5.7-am4/sha256__20fa31ec7885699e9a3c1e35eb7d71c9518c7bdd9483a2f2fdf062120f8fa14a:properties

We would also like to gather more information regarding this behavior.

1. Can you let us know which version of Artifactory you are in?
2. Is the replication a pull replication or a push replication from a local to a local repository?
3. Lastly, we would like to enable additional debug loggers to capture the replication behavior. In order to do so, please add the below logger to your $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/etc/artifactory/logback.xml file on all nodes of both the source and the target replication instance.


<logger name="org.artifactory.addon.replication.core">
<level value="trace"/>
</logger>

No restart is needed. Once added, please reproduce the replication issue by triggering a replication and then share the support bundle from both the source and the target instance. To create a new support bundle, in the Administration module, go to Support Zone, and click Create new support bundle.

Then send us everything. You can send us your files using the following cURL command.

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/184256/"

Please let us know in the above regard and we look forward to hearing from you.

According to the documentation, any properties defined with the prefix `artifactory.deploy.* should create a property on my artifact when uploaded to Artifactory. 
I have tried..artifactory.deploy.branch
env.artifactory.deploy.branch
system.artifactory.deploy.branch

artifactory.deploy.*.branch
env.artifactory.deploy.*.branch

Nothing works. Is the plugin currently broken? If so, is there any ETA on the fix?
I have tried adding an additional build step using the "Command Line" type and File Spec and it works correctly. It just seems to be broken for the "Gradle" "Ant" etc build types.

02s6900002PAP5LAAX5006900003YeigMAAR[#182288] Duplicate repositories however 1 has permission issueHi Francis,

Thank you for the update.

By default, the excluded patterns default is none and the included patterns default is all.  Please refer to the Repository Management documentation for additional information.

When looking for Jira tickets for the default exclude patterns, I was unable to find any Jira tickets.  If you would like, you can create a Jira account and create a Jira ticket to update the default exclude patterns.  Our Product and Development teams monitor Jira tickets for customer input when deciding which features to implement.

I can see the include and exclude patterns for the github-releases-remote and test-github repositories do seem to be similar, so this is an odd behavior that a download would be successful in one repository and not the other.

If you would like to discuss this issue in a session, I’d be happy to schedule a session with you.  Please provide your availability for a session and your preferred time zone.  I am based in San Francisco, so my time zone is PDT.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for sharing the Nginx configuration., it looks good. I also wanted to test accessing the individual node IP and check if the issue is with the nodes in themselves. Can you try to stop the instance on primary and then try accessing the member node through the IP and port in the UI:

http://<member-node-1-IP>:8082/artifactory and http://<member-node-2-IP>:8082/artifactory

Let us know if the UI behaves the same when accessing through the IP and port of member nodes as well. Also from the member node, please navigate to Administration -> Monitoring -> Service status, expand all the nodes and their services and share a screenshot at the time of the issue.

This is another approach to check if the issue is not on the LB side. Looking forward to hearing from you.

No my question is that I don't want the "Default Critical Block Policy" to be applied to certain path in the repo and create violations for them. The way the violations is created is when a watch is created and policy is applied to that watch.
So in theory since the watch is applied to a Repository and if we exclude some pattern from this repository (which is essentially the path to the images) then the Policy should not be applied to it and violations should not be created.

2021-10-25T16:44:05.896Z [jffe ] [ERROR] [                ] [                              ] [main                ] - ArtifactoryClient::http [get] request to /api/system/ping failed with 503 code

but the artifactory-service logs only contain logs from the 26th (the logs got rotated because of the previously mention log spam).

Now our 3-node Dev Jfrog cluster is up and running.  I have confirmed that the S3 direct download is good as well.

The one issue is that the LDAP integration on it seems to be broken.  Basically it shows “Error connecting to the LDAP server” when I do test connection in the edit LDAP settings screen.

I have uploaded a support bundle at "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/artifactory/logs/179791/devjfrog20211026-1635282385648_jfrt_jfrt@01fjwya3m0e1gb1vertzfw0pbg.zip"

I have tried to remove the LDAP setting all together and add it back. The error is still there.

Ben-Zvi,

Our Dev Jfrog instance is good now.  I’m cloning it to create additional 2 instances and add them to ALB.

I have followed the instruction to remove encrypted passwords.  Only issue I can see is that the LDAP integration seems to be broken even after I enter the password again in GUI.  I’ll try to remove LDAP config and add it again.

In the session today, we went over all the remaining errors in logs and discussed the possible cause and impact. ​

A few important ones to note are:

​  1. We see that property replication failed because of sync delete. We are disabling sync delete for now.

2. We see read time-out issues that on remote binary providers. It looks like a one-time error as it only appears in a short window. If this happens again, we should try to tune the remote binary provider timeout settings.

I would further check internally to see if it's worth opening a feature request for allowing presigning with files larger than 5 GB.

02s6900002PAP8oAAH5006900003YdlyvAAB[#181538] Fwd: Gearbox Artifactory Integration Questions/IssuesHi Ludovic,

I was able to test out using File Specs when Artifactory has multiple builds that have the same build number. I tested by doing the following utilizing the JFROG CLI

upload three different files and create three different builds, all with the same build number

jfrog rt u 8081-Nugetv3-Attempt-1635179195253.zip example-repo-local --build-name testbuild --build-number 123
jfrog rt bp testbuild 123
jfrog rt u xray-example-no-dependencies.png example-repo-local --build-name testbuild --build-number 123
jfrog rt bp testbuild 123
jfrog rt u babel-loader-8.2.2.tgz example-repo-local --build-name testbuild --build-number 123
jfrog rt bp testbuild 123

created a simple file spec file

joea-mac:case181538 joea$ cat fSpec 
{
   "files": [
       {
            "pattern": "example-repo-local/*",
            "target": ".",
            "build": "testbuild/123"
       }
   ]
}

performed a download

joea-mac:case181538 joea$ jfrog rt dl --spec fSpec 
 Log path: /Users/joea/.jfrog/logs/jfrog-cli.2021-10-26.19-34-53.57165.log
{
  "status": "success",
  "totals": {
    "success": 3,
    "failure": 0
  }
}


The artifacts from each build were downloaded. Therefore, in a situation where you have multiple builds with the same build number, the File Spec schema elements would need to better specify the particular file that you want to be downloaded.

Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.

​​​​​​​

edit artifactory.config.xml to switch from 3.1.21 to 3.0.5 but now I see a
bunch of errors.

I will do the full import of the bkup which I took prior to upgrade and see
if that works.

02s6900002PAP8yAAH5006900003jaV7NAAU[#183847] Single docker-compose Artifactory install failsHello Kami,

I don't think licenses/http settings/Base URl could cause this.

The original error message that stops artifactory from starting:

[ctoryContextConfigListener:128] [art-init            ] - Application could not be initialized: Error creating bean with name 'systemRepoFactory': Requested bean is currently in creation: Is there an unresolvable circular reference?


The root cause is that tomcat may not be loading certain java class and the correct order because the order of file listing (class files) is dependent on the platform.

Perhaps is best to try a clean re-deployment.

Paul Pan

Also, I am waiting on the call to proceed with this discussion.

02s6900002PAPAGAA55006900003jaixbAAA[#184108] JFROG Xray blocking low and medium vulnerabilitiesHi Nate,

I parsed through the Xray logs but I did not spot any issue on Xray's side. There may be an error on Artifactory's side that is resulting in the support bundle issue. Xray appears to be going through the process of scanning the binaries as expected.

Are you able to create an Artifactory support bundle or do you experience the same error? If you are experiencing the same issue in Artifactory let us go ahead and split this ticket into another ticket so that we can better organize the topics and this ticket will be kept on the topic of Xray and the blocking of unscanned Artifacts even though they are scanned.

If it is only for Xray go ahead and generate an Xray support bundle again and then an Artifactory support bundle and I will analyze the Artifactory logs and see where the process may be failing.

Best regards,
Derek Pang

02s6900002PAPAkAAP5006900003MoyWyAAJ[#179446] Watches and ignore rulesHi Scott,

Just wanted to reach out to you and update you that I was able to update my environment to more closely replicate yours with Artifactory 7.27.6 and Xray 3.23.0. I then performed the same steps as done previously. However, I received the same outcome, which was that the desired artifact download was allowed (un-blocked) only after navigating to the artifact's Xray tab in the UI. Let me know if the upgrade provided a different outcome for you.

Thank you for joining us on the call. We were able to see that the issue was with the NFS directory having incorrect permissions. Once we assigned the correct permissions artifactory:artifactory we could see that the replication was occurring without issues and the filesystem was filing up as expected.

As discussed, I will go ahead and close this ticket. Feel free to reach out to us and open a new ticket if you have any questions, in the future, we will be glad to assist you.

02s6900002PAPApAAP5006900003jaoHjAAI[#184236] Xray server is stoping intermittentlyHi,

Thanks for meeting.

During the session, we ran the below command and saw that the xray server process was being killed by OOM:
dmesg -T| grep -E -i -B100 'killed process'

As discussed, you can disable the OOM killer , or decrease max memory used by mongo . Or, you can add more RAM to the machine.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Thank you for the quick response.

I am still in the process of confirming if the _uploads folder is expected to be temporary and expected not to replicate to the target instance.  I can provide an update by my end of day Thursday.

Tha
In the current log level, I can see the 404 but not seeing any helpful information about the helm indexing issue. I am enabling trace level logs for helm indexing for the next 2 hours. I will check the logs and see if that's more helpful. If that's the case, we can sync again and find a window to try to reproduce the error and collect the indexing errors around the time of the issue. Thank you.

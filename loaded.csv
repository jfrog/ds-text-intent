2. The RabbitMQ logs. (Generally found under /var/log/rabbitmq directory)

Also is it possible to stop and start all Xray micro services?
If possible please perform stop all micro services and start again. As a temporary workaround, you may also try to remove the email id from the Xray configuration until all the alerts were sent. May be later you can configure the email id back.

All Ok with certification and SSL, I manage to configure Artifactory with SSL and Certificate.

On 6/11 you instruct to add some syntax and also you wrote that you tested in a Lab (email Attached)
I just want to say that if you tested in a LAB How you didn't get an error that maxThreads appear twice in the syntax?

<Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
   maxThreads="150" SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https" secure="true"
   clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
   keystoreFile="/Users/tataraov/tomcat_ssl.jks"
   keystorePass="****"
   keyAlias="myartifactory.com"
   sendReasonPhrase="true" relaxedPathChars='[]' relaxedQueryChars='[]' maxThreads="200"
/>

I fixed the problem by remove one of the maxThreads .
All Ok now.

Thanks for everything.

Now we have deferent problem on" AD synchronization problem".
Email sent on 14/11/2019' please advise.

Thank you for your response! We'll definitely look into `npm publish` and try that, but it's kind of weird because at first, we uploading the artifacts to `amplify-npm-local` (we changed it to npm-local to migrate to one npm repository). Using the scope of @amplifylitco, we were able to read artifacts using `npm show` and `npm install`. What is the difference here with the new repository npm-local?
Thanks!

Please see the screenshot below:

I’m also including the package.json from both the versions of appdynamics and also the verbose output from the install command.
Please see my relevant request.logs while resolving the packages:
20191116215858|116|REQUEST|10.128.0.95|admin|GET|/api/npm/npm-remote/appdynamics/-/appdynamics-4.5.11.tgz|HTTP/1.1|200|118893

To further investigate this behavior, please let us know some additional information from you:
1. Try “Zap cache” and try to resolve the artifacts and let us know if you are still experiencing the same behavior.
2. Could you please share the output from the below command: “npm install appdynamics@4.5.22 --verbose”
3. Also, reproduce the issue note the timestamp of the event and share the Artifactory support bundle, to see how the requests are coming in while resolving the packages, deploy the support bundle using the below command:

Thank you for the update.

In order to check what is the cause for the download slowness and to make sure it indeed takes long time after few days, as we saw that this operation consume most of the request time, we should perform the exact same test we have made during the session and to collect the same information.

Therefore, kindly enable again the nuget and http loggers and perform the same nguet install command ".\nuget install Microsoft.AspNetCore.All -source http://dev-artifactory.dev.local/artifactory/api/nuget/Nuget_org -verbosity detailed > C:\Temp\jfrog\nuget_out2.log" and provide us with the following information:

1. The exact operation time.
2. Complete nuget install output.
3. Artifactory support bundle that include the logs from the operation time.

Please note, the http loggers are very verbose, therefore, please make sure to disable them at the moment the NuGet client finish the install operation.

I'm looking forward to hear from you.

With regards to the indexing performance, if you remember one of the things we have changed during our last session is to decrease a bit the number of workers of the indexer in order to debug the OOM issue.
I am not sure if we have added it back to 8 workers or not, can you please verify it? If its not on 8 workers, please increase it back to 8 workers instead of 5.
This can be done under Xray admin tab -> General configuration, afterwards you will need to restart Xray for the changes to take effect.
This will improve the performance of the indexing.

If you still see that improvement is needed or not all artifacts were indexed, as my colleague Gajapathi suggested we will need the below information so we can check what went wrong with this certain artifacts or try to understand where is the bottleneck

In addition, if the bottleneck is big, we can debug this over a session and try to understand where is the bottleneck and how we can improve it to you, maybe additional tuning can be done.

Thank you for getting back to us.

When you configure Xray, you need to write down the name of the service instead of an actual ip.

Instead of:
http://10.20.5.98/

You will need to write something like:
http://artifactory-service/

So for example, for Artifactory it will look like the following:
http://artifactory-service:8081/artifactory

And for the Xray's base url it will look like:
http://xray-service/

I am not sure about the names of the services on your end, but if you will follow along my example and still don't manage to connect, please share with me the 'kubectl get svc' output and the actual error that is thrown in the UI.

We are looking forward for your reply.

Please find the quote of the previous email below:

Could you please elaborate on your current Xray <> Artifactory <> SAML setup and if there are any redirects or a load-balancer in from of them? From our past experience, this also might be related to a load-balancer/reverse proxy configuration in between the Xray and Artifactory instances.

The error:

AADSTS900561: The endpoint only accepts POST requests. Received a GET request.

Might indicate that a POST request after receiving a HTTP 301 from a load balancer changed into a GET request.

We could inspect the relevant logs to verify that.

Thank you for reaching out JFrog Support.
My name is Shai and I will assist you on this case.

If I understand the issue currently the AD directory is connected to the Crowd server which is connected to Artifactory, is that correct?
I attempted to reproduce this behavior by using Crowd against Artifactory with the same version (6.12).
I was able to connect with the newly created user by using username and password and API key without issues, even after re-generating the API key more than once I was able to access and download a file.

In order to investigate this behavior, please provide us with the following information:

1. Does the issue reproduced with any user or only a specific one?
2. Did you try to use couple of times the API key or only a single time?
3. Do you see any error or warnings in the artifactory.log when trying to authenticate?
4. Which client you use when trying to authenticate against Artifactory with the API key? Does it reproduce also with regular cURL command?
5. Please provide us with the name of the user which failed to login and the time of failure.
6. Please provide us with a Support Bundle from Artifactory, so we can inspect the current configuration as well.
Please make sure that it contains the Artifactory access log and the logs from the Access service.

To collect the Support Bundle, please go to Admin -> Advanced -> Support Zone. Create and download the bundle and note the time of the error if possible.

You may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:
curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/118036/"


After saying the above, please note that in ticket number 99129 (February 20) you had a similar issue with LDAP.
And I can see that there was also an Nginx in the middle, is that still the case? If yes, will it be possible to bypass the Nginx during the tests?

Looking forward to your reply.

There is an Azure Proxy in the way.

10.250.153.122:8000 (docker)                    xray.gd.didata.local

artifactory.dimensiondata.com -> Azure Proxy (443) -> 10.250.153.121:8081

Xray -> artifactory.dimensiondata.com is how the association is setup.

Hi Aram,

Please find the quote of the previous email below:


Could you please elaborate on your current Xray <> Artifactory <> SAML setup and if there are any redirects or a load-balancer in from of them? From our past experience, this also might be related to a load-balancer/reverse proxy configuration in between the Xray and Artifactory instances.

The error:

AADSTS900561: The endpoint only accepts POST requests. Received a GET request.
Might indicate that a POST request after receiving a HTTP 301 from a load balancer changed into a GET request.

We could inspect the relevant logs to verify that.

Thank you for the follow up and for sharing the use-case in details.

Currently, there is no way to trigger a backup on the secondary node, as there are reserved tasks (for example, backups), specifically for the primary node to perform in the HA cluster.
The only way to 'workaround' this matter is to configure the HA environment with NFS. For more information, please refer to this WIKI page.
As a side note, we do have plans to change the current behavior however, there are no further details to share at the moment.

I hope this clarifies further.

Thank you for reaching out JFrog Support.
My name is Shai and I will assist you on this case.

Please note that the membership port is something that can be configured on the ha-node.properties file on each node which can be found under the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc folder.
Please check the Dev primary and secondary ha-node.properties files and see if the member port is missing or having a wrong membership port value.
A restart will be require in order for the changes to take effect.

With regards to warnings of:

2019-07-30 07:24:26,039 [pool-14-thread-1] [JFrog-Access] [WARN ] (o.j.c.ExecutionUtils:69) - Retry 1

failed: Couldn't publish changes to another cluster peer [http://10.215.233.209:8086/artif]. Status

code: 401. Trying again


Does the warning that you get is when the primary is down or after you have upgraded it?
If this happen while the primary node is down, this may be an expected behavior.
Any changes like deployment, changes of configurations cannot be propagated to the primary while it's down.
The HA mechanism is as follow:
Let's assume you create a repository and the request is done against the secondary node.
What will happen is that the secondary node will update the config descriptor on database.
This will also trigger an event for the primary node that something was changed in the config descriptor and the primary node will try to reload the config descriptor in order be able reflect the changes (adding new repository).

But when the primary node is down, the event will not reach it (and that is why you get 401), however, when the primary node will be up again, he will try again to reload the changes, in case the communications are configured correctly.

It's expected to see some warnings and exceptions while doing the upgrade, and it's also mentioned in the Wiki, due to versions inconsistency until all the nodes are in the same version.

Thank you for the follow up. I am glad that the KB is helpful.

In regards to the exact steps required to download all the dependencies from remote repository, we can simply configure a Smart Remote Repository:
1. Please add a type of repository (i.e: Maven, Pypi, etc')
2. Point the URL to an existing repository within the external Artifactory (so the enclosed instance will point to the production environment's desired repository)

Alternatively, we can use Pull replication:

1.Under the desired repository (via Artifactory UI), navigate to the 'Replications' tab
2.Edit the Cron Expression field with the replication task schedule using a valid cron expression

*Please do not forget to enter the credentials in the Advanced tab of the above repository (credentials used to pull the artifacts from).

Hope this clarifies further. Please let me know if additional assistance is required, I'll be glad to help.

Thank you for reaching out JFrog Support.
My name is Shai and I will assist you on this case.

In generic repositories there is no metadata for artifacts, so Artifactory has no way to know what is the latest version of each package.
Isn't the Grabber.js a third pary NPM library? If yes, maybe a good idea will be to put it on an NPM repository instead and Artifactory will be able to generate metadata for it.

In addition, maybe there should be also a different layout for the package dependencies such as adding another directory inside like version where each version will have it's own path.

Did you consider also adding properties manually?

Looking forward to your reply.

Thank you for your response.

Setting the Storage Space Limit under the Maintenance Configuration will not send an email notification, however, it will display an error on the Artifactory UI if said limit has been reached.

Artifactory offers to receive mail notification when setting a watch on a repository, an unsupported license was found in a deployed component or to send Mail to Admins if there are Backup Errors.

However, Artifactory allows you to extend its behavior with User Plugins written in Groovy.
For this purpose we suggest you to use Artifactory Storage Quota Warning User Plugin.

Let me know if the above was helpful.

Thank you for the clarification.

Since your subscription includes adding User-Plugins, we can add this User-Plugin to your instance "hclproducts".
As mentioned in the public Github repo, the plugin is destined to clean Docker repositories based on configured cleanup policies.
For example, we can set the maxCount parameter or maxDays and based on these, Artifactory will clean unwanted docker images.

Looking forward to hearing your inputs in this regards.

Best regards,

Issue was again related to antivirus.
I've succeeded sending a test email using Artifactory UI.
I then changed the Storage Space Limit (Percentage) to 50% to get the disk storage alert and expected to get emails alert, but this one didn't happen.

Thanks,

Hi Shai,

Thank you for your response.

After configuring Artifactory Mail server, the emails will be delivered using an SMTP protocol.
Artifactory does not use 'curl' or 'PowerShell' to trigger these email deliveries.

Hope this clarifies.

Thank you for the question.

The reason it is not recommended to aggregate many repositories under one virtual is because each query will take as long as it takes for Artifactory to look under each repository that is aggregated for a specific image.

This might not be an issue if each repository has small amount of images, but for larger repositories, it can get quite cumbersome.

The way you chose to arrange your repositories is quite effective since you have a strict and explanatory naming convention for images and luckily for docker, you just need to specify the image name in order to direct it to the right repository without prior client configurations so it means you can scale up easily.

Hope this clarifies.
Let us know if you have any additional questions, we'll be happy to help.

....

From previous cases, we saw the above errors appear in the logs when there is a heavy load on Artifactory; it causes the worker queue to be full and so it can not serve additional tasks.
This seems to be suitable for your case as well (the failure of the Support Bundle creation is because of the same reason the replication is slow).

In order to tune Artifactory to handle heavy load I highly suggest to review this helpful KB article.

In addition, as mentioned in the KB, by changing a few of Artifactory properties we can increase the number of async processes that can run in parallel:

Under $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/artifactory.system.properties, edit/add the following:

artifactory.async.corePoolSize=128
artifactory.async.poolMaxQueueSize = 20000 (Shouldn’t be more than 8x the machine CPU cores)

Restart Artifactory for the changes to take effect

In general, the replication (as other Artifactory processes) are dependent on Artifactory's machine resources and usage, so we should take this under consideration as well. Here you can find additional useful KB, about monitoring and optimizing Artifactory performance.

In case you experience further issues after the above change, kindly provide an updated set of logs (preferably complete Support Bundle):
- $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/logs directory

I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

You will need to add on Xray side the policy with 'fail build, and on the CI side (on the pipeline script) you may just change the 'fail build' to false in case you to whitelist him (so he will not fail), and then Xray will be able to scan the builds but will not fail it, and just generate violations for it.

Does the above answers your use case?

Looking forward to your reply.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
My name is Shai and I will assist you on this case.

You should be able to create a package with both enterprise account and OSS account.
We can see that you are using the Gradle Bintray plugin in order to create and publish packages to Bintray, is that correct?
If yes, please note that you will have to be the owner of the repository and for OSS packages the 'licenses' and the 'vcs_url' fields are mandatory, and there are certain fields like custom_licenses and public_stats which can only be used by premium accounts (in case some of them are being used in your script).

Can you let us know what is the build.gradle plugin script that you are using?
Were you able to create the package or was it already existing?

We ask the above since by inspecting the logs on our side, we could observe that the package 'smartphone' was created successfully along with a version and artifacts were uploaded to it successfully:

Thank you for your response.

The best way to approach this is to install Artifactory HA on a Test environment in Azure, prior to implementing these changes to the production environment. Please view the “Steps to follow” section in the “Enterprise Cloud DevOps on Azure is Clicks Away” article, as it will describe how to install and configure Artifactory HA in Azure portal.

Afterwards you are able to start the migration process, however, before starting the migration process, we will need to verify the following:
1. Artifactory versions - All the installed Artifactory HA nodes will need to be the same version
2. Verify the following configuration files are synchronized:
ha-node.properties
db.properties
binarystore.xml
master.key
Since changes on one node are automatically synchronized to the other nodes, take care not to simultaneously modify the same file on two different nodes since changes you make on one node could overwrite the changes you make on the other one.
3. Edit the ha-node.properties File - You will need to locate the ha-node.properties file in each node under the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc and comment out or remove the following entries otherwise Artifactory will continue write according to the previous path you have configured to the shared file system.

artifactory.ha.data.dir=/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory-ha
artifactory.ha.backup.dir=/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory-backup
4. After going through the above steps, you may copy the data to the new location, however, as this step differs from one setup to another, kindly let me know what from what filestore you desire to migrate your binaries to the Azure storage.
5. Configure binarystore.xml - When configuring the binarystore.xml file, you will configure the Azure Blob Storage Cluster Binary Provider as the filestore for Artifactory HA.
To modify the binarystore.xml file for a node, you first need to gracefully shut down the node, modify the file and then restart the node in order for your new configuration to take effect

After going through the above steps, you will be able to test your new environment.
In case you encounter any issues during the steps above, please share with us in detail the steps you taken and what is the behavior you encountered.

Waiting for your response.

Thank you for the information provided.

I have tried to replicate this behaviour using the provided steps:
I have uploaded 2 packages with the same name and version(oron-1.0.0), one package scoped under @test:



Browsing to Artifactory Packages view I could see the 2 modules, 1 version for each:



I was able to reproduce the behaviour where clicking on the unscoped package i can see the description of the scoped one ( I have added a description to the scoped package "this is a scoped package"):





However, this did not affect or caused any errors when trying to install the regular or the scoped package.


In addition, I would like to get more information in order to further investigate this issue :

1. Please trigger recalculation of the metadata for the npm repository by right clicking on the repository name and click on the "Zap Caches" button. Then try installing the package again and let me know if you still encounter the "integrity checksum failed" error.

2. Please share with me the metadata files (for both the packages) that Artifactory generates for the packages. These are the 'package.json' files created under the ".npm" sub-folder in the repository. I would like to see if there are any inconsistencies between them.

3. lastly, in case the metadata recalculation did not help and the error still exists, I would like to add a logger to Artifactory which should give us more information. Please add the following snippet to the logback file found under $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc directory :

<appender name="npm-log" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
<File>${artifactory.home}/logs/npm.log</File>
<encoder>
<pattern>%date ${artifactory.contextId}[%thread] [%-5p] \(%-20c{3}:%L\) - %m%n</pattern>
</encoder>
<rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.FixedWindowRollingPolicy">
<FileNamePattern>${artifactory.home}/logs/npm-log.%i.log</FileNamePattern>
<maxIndex>13</maxIndex>
</rollingPolicy>
<triggeringPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy">
<MaxFileSize>10MB</MaxFileSize>
</triggeringPolicy>
</appender>


<logger name="org.artifactory.addon.npm" additivity="false">
<level value="trace"/>
<appender-ref ref="npm-log" />
</logger>

<logger name="org.jfrog.repomd.npm" additivity="false">
<level value="trace"/>
<appender-ref ref="npm-log" />
</logger>

No restart of Artifactory is needed for the change to take affect.

After configuring the logback file, please reproduce the behaviour and then share with me Artifactory Support bundle, which contains Artifactory's configuration files as well as the logs. I would like to search for the new npm logs to see if we can identify the reason for this behaviour.

Support Bundle can be created from Artifactory UI, under Admin tab → Advanced | Support zone. Ensure that all boxes are checked and click “create”.
It will generate a Support bundle which can be uploaded using the following curl command:

$ curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/117267/"
(No username or password required)


I will be looking forward to your update.

Please advise on best solution to rename users.

The Artifactory server has to switch AD from Cisco.com LDAP to Synamedia.com LDAP.
Some of the users remain with same user names.
However some users have a different user name in "Synamedia.com"

Currently in the server, user permission are configured both in permissions and in groups.

Here are the options that I see:

1.       Make the change in the DB
(this server is using the built in Derby DB)
I don't know how this is done
in this jira case it appears as a possibility: https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-18475

2.       Write a script to use the REST API to create new users wherever the username changed... replace each one of those users in the groups and permissions where the previous user had rights.

If there are other options please let me know

Please advise on best solution to rename users.

Thank you

We have tried to reproduce this issue, however, deploying large Docker images to Artifactory (layers over 1GB) have triggered successful scans in Xray.

By looking in the provided log, we can see that the error message is "unexpected EOF" while Xray was downloading the image from Artifactory, in order to scan it. This error implies that Artifactory, or any network component between, has closed the connection without sending the full response. Does it occur each time you try to scan a large image, or is it intermittent?

Is it possible for you to send us an example of such Docker image? This will help us reproduce the issue in our lab and investigate it better.
In addition, kindly send us Support Bundles from Artifactory and Xray, including the image name and time frame of the deployment.
You may send the files with this command:

The timeout may indicate that the repository wasn't reachable or there is an issue with the proxy configuration, since there should not be an issue with pinging against Maven Oracle repository.

In order to be able to deploy artifacts from Maven Oracle repository you will have to sign up for their repository.
Once signed up, there is also an Eula which needs to approved.
Once done, you will have to put the credentials of the signed user on Artifactory on the advanced tab, in order for Artifactory to authenticate with it.

As you can see from the output you have provided, Oracle creates a challenge for a user (see bold text):

Host: login.oracle.com
> Accept: */*

< Server: Oracle-HTTP-Server
< Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
< Pragma: no-cache
< Content-Length: 0
< Expires: 0
< Set-Cookie:

Since you have provided user name and password, it is possible that only the EULA creates the issue.
Can you try to install maven artifacts even though the Maven test button still fails?

For example, I tested the repository with the following pom.xml file and it was succeeded:

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.oracle.jdbc</groupId>
<artifactId>ojdbc8</artifactId>
<version>12.2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
</project>

Looking forward to your reply.

My name is Ethan Hemo, I'm currently working for Migdal insurance company.
We are trying to connect our docker servers to our artifactory docker repository through HAProxy, but we came to some issues when using SSL.
We have found the following link to try and handle the issue but failed:
https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/how-to-configure-haproxy-with-artifactory/

Can you please provide the link to which URL should we refer our requests from docker?
It seems that docker looking for the address https://<repo_server>/v2<https://%3crepo_server%3e/v2> but we can't tell to which URL we should forward the requests to.

Thanks,
Ethan Hemo.

We are running artifactory 3 node cluster in prod on v 6.12.2 - all 3 cluster running Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.7 (Maipo)
We are undergoing a share migration for our cluster (cifs share) and so we shutdown the application. We did NOT do any service installation since there is an ongoing issue with redhat 7 and artifactory start up script. We normally do ./artifactory.sh start or stop to start & stop the artifactory. 
Today, when we shutdown the app using ./artifactory.sh stop; artifactory shutdown. But after a few seconds, we observed that it was trying to start up by itself.when I did a ps -ef, this is what I saw:[wasmgr@plgsasartifac01 bin]$ ps -ef | grep artifactoryroot     16403 14903  0 08:03 pts/1    00:00:00 /usr/share/centrifydc/libexec/dzdo /bin/systemctl restart artifactory.service -lwasmgr   16617  4923  0 08:03 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto artifactory

Is this something you are aware of ? We need your inputs to prevent such auto restarts from happening.

Thank you for the reply.

In reference to ticket 112484, I do not believe that executing security info broadcast should/will create additional tokens.
In addition and with regards to the question about deleting the tokens from the JSON file, for now, I advise you to delete complete and old backup files.
So, if we have access-backup files that are older than a week, we can safely delete those. Each change to the Access server (such as: adding users, tokens, etc') will create a new backup file, so, assuming we have frequent backups of Access, there's no need to save older backups.
After discussing the ETA of Artifactory's major release with the Product Team, I'm happy to share with you the estimated release timeframe is Q1-20.

Looking forward to your inputs.

Thank you for your response.

When saying "Obviously I already had my Kubernetes credentials working and in my environment." - do you mean that the Artifactory HA environment works at your end with no problems until the system import? if so, please share with us how did you perform the system import ? also please share an updated support bundles from the k8s cluster (kindly from all the nodes in the cluster).

The bundle can be achieved from Artifactory UI under the Admin tab →Advanced →Support zone.

Ensure that all of the boxes are checked, then click "create" and save the zip file.

If it is less than 5 MB, you may send the files directly to us using the Support Portal or email.

Otherwise, you may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:

I'm quoting your previous message:
"I further checked internally to know more information regarding the API calls made to your Bintray account, we noticed that the ApiQuota limit(near to 100%)
was reached on "Mon Aug 27 2018 20:36". However, the account was functional till Nov 5th 2019 until the ApiQuota reached its maximum. We could not trace back
further as we have the log information only for ~3 months."

I still don't understand what exactly I did wrong regarding the apiQuota.
If I read this, it means I have a quota of 300/day and 1440/month: https://bintray.com/docs/api/#_limits

I'm sure that I've never reached 300 queries/day, that's why I asked for further clarifications.

What exactly did I do wrong and how can I make sure I don't do this again?

Thanks,

Wim

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to your inquiry, we are not aware of an issue with the Artifactory script making restart itself.
Moreover, we tried but were not able to reproduce it with RHEL 7.7 and Artifactory 6.12.2. We used the zip installation, but not observed an automatic restart when running $ ./artifactory.sh stop or $ kill -9 pid.

You may run the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/bin/uninstallService.sh script to make sure there is no service installation on the server.
Please check if there is a 3rd party script/tool making restart to the Artifactory script on shutdown/kill.


Furthermore, the issue with running artifactory as a service using zip installation was resolved in version 6.14.0, however, we would recommend to upgrade to the latest version fro the moment which is 6.14.1.


Let us know if you have more questions or need further assistance. We will be glad to help.

After further investigation, we have found the root cause.
When you try to overwrite an image with the plugin on, the layers change but the manifest.json does not since it is the only file that can be overwritten.

If the layer exist in Artifactory, then it will not be pushed anyway.
If the layer does not exist, it will be added.

That means that the only file that is not overwritten is the manifest.json and this what makes the unknown blob error.

That being said, the plugin is not suitable for docker repositories.

We suggest you to take a look at our public api for writing custom user-plugins.

In addition, we tracked an old JIRA for this improvement.
You can vote and watch it for further updates.

169.177.209.51 - - - - [15/Nov/2019:04:29:28 -0500] "GET /artifactory/ui/artifactbuilds?path=javax%2Finject%2Fjavax.inject%2F1%2Fjavax.inject-1.jar&repoKey=maven-central-remote-cache HTTP/1.1" 499 0 "https://www.artifactrepository.citigroup.net/artifactory/webapp/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/77.0.3865.90 Safari/537.36" 41.181

Could you perform investigation of this API, and help to provide us an urgent solution. We may look to temporarily disable access to this end-point. Could you give us your thoughts on us doing that also.

Thanks,

Joe

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

We are familiar with the issue when under certain conditions a download of a NuGet package from local repository fails.
There is an internal JIRA RTFACT-20436 ticket for this matter.

A fix to the mentioned issue was included in the Artifactory version 6.14.0 and we have received the feedback from other customers that it resolved the issue on their end.
As an Artifactory SaaS customer of ours, you are running Artifactory version 6.11.3 at the moment.
We may try to upgrade your instance to the version which has this fix and see if it works for you as well.

Please note that we would need your approval to proceed with the upgrade procedure.


Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Valeriy Petrov

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

According to the error message it looks like the access was denied due to invalid credentials.

However, to better understand the problem, please generate and share with us the Artifactory Support Bundle and the contents of settings.xml (mask sensitive data).

To collect the support bundle, please navigate to [Artifactory UI] → [Admin] → [Advanced] → [Support Zone].
Use the following cURL command to upload the files to this support case:

I create a DR setup in Mission Control. Then in the dropdown menu of possible Actions, I try Init in order to initialize it. At that point, I get the storage related error which is viewable in the attached file. 
However, when comparing the memory distribution between Austin (Master) and Dallas (Target), it looks like the Target might even have more available memory than the Master. (see attachments Master, and Target) 
May i get an explanation of the mechanism being applied here, which makes it so that the Target is seemingly running out storage space?

We've all seen the rise and fall of Cryptocurrencies and have differing opinions about it.  Many on Wall St. would love the opportunity to short this stuff but aside from the CME futures product there are limited options (and the CME Product only applies to Bitcoin ( https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin.html ) ).  Furthermore, most of the short selling alternatives in Crypto are cumbersome and not compliant with securities regulations.  If you're not up to speed on the Crypto debate you can checkout Splitting Bits - Understanding Bitcoin and the Blockchain ( https://pleaseorderit.com/splitting-bits-digital-book-understanding-bitcoin-and-the-blockchain/ ).

DLCC Digital Lending Capital Corp ( https://www.dlcc.co/ ) has built a prototype that allows the compliant short selling of digital assets in the same way stocks are sold short; there is a locate, borrow, and lend that facilitate the short sale so it's not 'naked' short selling - short sellers borrow the asset from a lender and then sell it short, to be covered at a time in the future - just like public securities are shorted.

Thank you for the update and providing the information.
I have further verified the use-case and reproduced the similar behaviour in my lab and I can able to resolve the artifacts(which are not cached) from virtual repository by enabling the "Artifactory Requests can Retrieve Remote Artifacts" check box in the Advanced tab of Maven Virtual repository as shown below. I recommend you to enable this option in Source Artifactory  Maven Virtual Repository (in your use case ArtifactoryA) and try reproducing the issue and let us know the results. Meanwhile I will further check internally on this behaviour and let you know update.



I would also request you to provide Curl command along with the complete output  you are using by adding/removing X-Artifactory-Originated header.
Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for getting back to us.

A server connection timeout error does little to tell us what went wrong since timeout errors can happen for several reasons.

What we can tell that in this step JFrog CLI will issue a GET request to api/security/encryptedPassword endpoint to verify a connection to the remote Artifactory host.

You might want to debug this further with the following cURL command (share the output with us):

$ curl -XGET -uadmin:&lt;API_KEY&gt; &lt;ARTIFACTORY_URL&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/artifactory/api/security/encryptedPassword -vvvL


Please make sure that if you have a firewall or proxy on the way to Artifactory it allows you to make a connection.


Looking forward to your update.

Does this happen only to a specific package/repository or there are more examples of this issue?

Through the application server I can setup CNTLM, which authenticates through the Proxy, using the service account that has been created. I can then use jfrog cli tool and the parameters as outlined in Xray to download the vulnerability database. Therefore through the server I can connect to the websites you have mentioned previously. Given that we can access these websites, it implies that this is not a whitelist issue.

Regards

Sam.

Hi Sam,

Thank you for your reply and for sending the logs.

I have reviewed the logs you sent, and I can see the following error:
[2019/11/14 11:20:57 NZDT] [EROR] (jfrog.com/xray/internal/service/monitoring.keepAliveJFrogVendorUpdates:83) Failed to read response from jxrayUrl. Error: Get https://jxray.jfrog.io/api/v1/system/ping: proxyconnect tcp: dial tcp: lookup https on 10.104.81.5:53: no such host

Based on the above error, I suspect that this could be a whitelist issue. If you have a firewall in your organisation, you need to make sure that the following URL's are cleared in the firewall settings:

Please make sure that the above URL's are accessible. In addition, you may check communication to JXray by pinging:  https://jxray.jfrog.io/api/v1/system/ping

We are looking forward to your update.

Hi Paul,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

We are familiar with the issue when under certain conditions a download of a NuGet package from local repository fails.
There is an internal JIRA RTFACT-20436 ticket for this matter.

A fix to the mentioned issue was included in the Artifactory version 6.14.0 and we have received the feedback from other customers that it resolved the issue on their end.
As an Artifactory SaaS customer of ours, you are running Artifactory version 6.11.3 at the moment.
We may try to upgrade your instance to the version which has this fix and see if it works for you as well.

Please note that we would need your approval to proceed with the upgrade procedure.


Looking forward to hearing back from you.

I was referred to this case by Lilach.
In short before we will be able to remove any such ciphers RnD will need to
confirm whether all expected outcomes render similarly after such a change.
We can tweak the staging environment to remove such ciphers, but we'll need
full testing cycles to follow such change to assure no technologies are
broken.

@Yoav Landman <yoavl@jfrog.com> / @Hila Mazinter <hilam@jfrog.com> this
would require QA time for full sanity on BIntray - can we allocate such
time in the near future?

@Eyal Hakim <eyalh@jfrog.com> will be able to work on determining which
ciphers suites to remove if we can dedicate the testing time.

THanks,

Doron

Please advise regarding the below:

We have 2 production artifactory servers that we plan to upgrade. 

Server1 Info
1- Located in Shannon/Ireland with version 5.8.3 that was an upgrade of version 4.14.4
2- Configured behind an https reverse proxy 
3- 32 CPU and we have 256 GB RAM and only 32GB of memory allocated to artifactory in default file 
4- Server uses only one large git-lfs repository that is now of size 3.6 TB no other repos there  

We can see the below in logs since the last upgrade.

2019-11-17 11:27:09,321 [art-exec-4] [WARN ] (o.a.s.j.m.p.RepoPathChecksumMigrationJobDelegate:110) - Path Checksum calculation job (for existing artifacts) has been disabled and will not run, there are still 906028 artifacts without path checksum values in the database. Futu                   re version of Artifactory may enforce this conversion as a prerequisite for upgrades.
2019-11-17 11:27:09,937 [art-exec-3] [INFO ] (o.a.s.j.m.s.Sha256MigrationJobDelegate:180) - SHA256 migration job (for existing artifacts) is disabled and will not run, there are 823140 artifacts without SHA256 values in the database.  Future versions of Artifactory may enforc                   e this migration as a prerequisite for upgrades.

Questions now please:

1- Advise if this SHA migration is now mandatory to be done or not  and please provide steps to do it, please dont use links you can send us the clear steps 
2- We have more than 900k artifact so how long will this migration take?
3- Could you please advise a clear upgrade plan based on the above, what is the version that we should go to?

Server2 Info:

1- Located in Wilsonville/USA with version 5.8.3 as it was configured after the first one so that is the original version
2- Configured behind an https reverse proxy 
3- 24 CPU and we have 48 GB RAM and only 16GB of memory allocated to artifactory in default file 
4- Server uses only one large git-lfs repository that is now of size 3.6 TB no other repos there, this is remote repo of the server in Shannon/Ireland
5- I don't see same warning in logs as the other server, so how to know if sha256 is enabled or not 

Questions now please:
1- Could you please advise a clear upgrade plan based on the above for Server2, what is the version that we should go to?

Do we have to upgrade 2 servers in same day.

Kindly provide a clear plan and steps, will try to test it on a test server first and follow with you about updates. 

Thanks in advance,Mai Saleh

The request fails for all of the images I previously mentioned.
When searching for `alpinecont` on the components tab I'm able to see the image exists, but the specific tag of `0904aa4` does not appear when I go into the details for the `alpineconf` image. However, If I navigate to the package search on Artifactory I'm able to locate the image/tag and it shows that Xray has the status of high.

Java process is using 70% of swap allocated. Currently we have 4GB of Swap allocated.
Java process has 8GB of memory allocated, below are settings defined.

Thank you for your response.
I am able to extract the unzip n2c3_build_base_image.tar.
The above file is built from different layers. In one of those layers there is a file named fail-issue5747.bz2. This is the reason for the issue.
The docker image is built in house by you correct ?
Do you recognize the file mentioned above?
Are you able to extract it ?
Regrading the astropy-1.1.2.tar.gz file, it’s the same root cause as the above.
I will try to find the files that are causing the issue there as well.

Thank you for your response.
Migration to an Artifactory edge node is not possible. You will need to migrate to an Artifactory instance.
Regarding migration depending on the size of your Artifactory we will recommend different path to achieve the migration.
Path one:
What is the best way to migrate a large Artifactory instance with minimal downtime?
The above uses a “skeleton” migration. Copy the filestore to the new location, setup a database on the new location, export the metadata from the previous Artifactory instance and import to the new Artifactory.
This is for large Artifactory instances.
Path two:
Create a full system export and import. May create a huge export package which is why path one is recommended as it divides the process.
Please share with us the storage page or your Artifactory instance, so we may have a better understanding in which path to choose.
Looking forward to your response.

Ohad Levy

Thank you for the update.

We have carefully reviewed the recent logs and it looks like you are running into a known issue with the multi-push replication in Artifactory 5.11.1 described in the following JIRA:

https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-17500


$ zgrep "ReplicationServiceImpl:101" artifactory.*

2019-10-26 10:59:36,304 [art-init] [WARN ] (o.a.a.r.c.ReplicationServiceImpl:101) - Multi Push Replication Feature is available only for artifactory with High availability License

According to the recent logs, last time the non-event-based replication to COB instance started on Oct29 and Oct31:

$ zgrep "Executing file list request" artifactory.* | grep "basesoftware-snapshot-cob-local" | grep "https://rb-cmbinex-kor-p1.apac.bosch.com/artifactory/api/storage/basesoftware-snapshot-cob-local"

2019-10-31 12:32:38,782 [art-exec-59698] [INFO ] (o.a.a.r.c.BaseReplicationProducer:146) - Executing file list request: 'https://rb-cmbinex-kor-p1.apac.bosch.com/artifactory/api/storage/basesoftware-snapshot-cob-local/?list&deep=1&listFolders=1&mdTimestamps=1&statsTimestamps=1&includeRootPath=1'


$ zgrep "Replication activated with cron expression.*https://rb-cmbinex-kor-p1.apac.bosch.com/artifactory/basesoftware-snapshot-cob-local" artifactory.*

Returns 0 results, meaning that the cron replication for this repo is not activated.



Possible solutions:

1) Upgrade the Artifactory instance to version 6.8.0 or above (RTFACT-17500). Please take into consideration that Artifactory version 5.11.1 will reach its End of Life this week, on November 21st.

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/End+of+Life


2) Implement COB -> KOR -> SZH replication, for example, instead of a multi-push COB -> KOR + COB -> SZH;


Please let us know how you would like to proceed.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your response.
Please make sure you didn't add a “_” at the end of the rest request.
Kindly let us know if you have a Proxy in front of Artifactory or Xray, Controlling any incoming outgoing requests. It would appear the API command reached a Proxy which did not direct it to the Xray instance.
In case you do have a proxy please review its configuration to see that the request is indeed not stopped by it. Please also send us the conf file of the proxy so we may also review it. Lastly if possible, try to bypass the proxy and see if you get a 200 response back, just for testing.
Looking forward to you response.

Re-creating the keystore without the two additional certs is something I am happy to do, but from my testing the first time around I do not believe it will not change the operational status of the product.I will take a look at the Oracle document that you have sent through, but I may need more ideas.

None are showing any Security Violations after an hour or so. I was, however, able to Assign a Custom Issue of type Security and have that show up in the UI.

Any additional guidance would be appreciated.

Subject: [#118072] Xray - No Issues

Hi Adam,

From what you have described it looks like the Xray global database has not been synchronized after you have installed and started using Xray. Xray uses data from its global database to map vulnerabilities and security issues to the components that have been indexed and scanned.

If the indexing and scanning has been completed and Xray is reporting "Scanned-No issues", then most probably the Global database has not been synchronized even once after the installation. After installing Xray the Global database sync needs to be invoked manually for the first time and once it has completed, it will update itself automatically on a daily basis.

Here is the link in our wiki<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.jfrog.com_confluence_display_XRAY_Configuring-2BXray-23ConfiguringXray-2DSynchronizingtheDatabase&d=DwMCAw&c=sikn4k7V2lFfPJrXJSlA4R7A6Kq6YaohJAiPI6s0BuE&r=xtb1k4cm6XN3vc3P4P7jWmDJcnl54mdl1Zb4DY77pPs&m=X0w7DQ4_i-GfvUGZuZSJ766yCmtZkSHqx_y8MSKCJRY&s=mMHBVYMm1gVSIRsfb0XDnj3WvTzBgmFr0Mp7HYrhDso&e=> explaining about invoking and synchronizing the global database. In the Xray home page or if you navigate to the Admin ->Database sync page you should be able to see when was the last time the Global database sync was completed.

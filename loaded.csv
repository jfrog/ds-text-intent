Sure, I can try to find another solution for you. However to speed along the process can you please answer all questions and perform all of the tests that are within this email?

To further investigate this issue, I would like for you to do the following:

Please delete content and zap cache for kafka-clients on cloudera-remote-cache repository.
Then, let me know if you can download kafka-client-2.2.1-cdh6.3.3.jar from your cloudera-remote and libs-release repositories from the Artifactory UI.
Are you able to download kafka-client-2.2.1-cdh6.3.3.jar using curl? Please provide the output of below command:

curl -O http://admin:[your_password]@artifactory.fepoc.com/artifactory/[remtote/virtual-repo-name]/org/apache/kafka/kafka-clients/2.2.1-cdh6.3.3/kafka-clients-2.2.1-cdh6.3.3.jar -vvv

I would also like to know if you have any certificates being used for your remote repo that uses cloudera. If so, please send them to me so that I can relay that information to our developers

After all of the above information has been gathered please run the "mvn install" command and send me an updated support bundle (with logs and configuration files included). Please give the time of the reproduction attempt as well. You can send me your files with the following curl command:

curl -i -T filename.ext “https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/185439/”

I want to quickly clarify what our infrastructure looks like: we have a self-hosted 2 node HA cluster in AWS which I am referring to as our cloud deployment, and a single node self-hosted deployment in the datacenter in our office which is the on prem deployment.
To my knowledge, the appropriate rules have been set up to allow communication between our cloud environments and on prem datacenters. I had anticipated that if there were going to be problems, it would be on prem trying to contact the cloud resources, but instead it is the other way around.

I did identify an issue with our AWS environment where it could not resolve the FQDN of the on prem instance and have since fixed that issue. From the cloud instances I can successfully ping the on prem instance using the FQDN, and nmap reports that http and https ports are open, as well as ports 8045, 8080, 8081, and 8082. Using curl is also successful.

In the 'Register Platform Deployment' screen I am inputting 'https://gbx-artifactory.gearboxsoftware.com'. Should I be entering it differently?

Thanks for your help in this matter,
Andrew Schneider

Subject: [#187317] SUPPORT - Request For Linking Deployments & Setting Up Replication

Hello Ludovic,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
My name is Andrew and I will be assisting you with this adding platform deployment issue.

I see that you're following the Managing Platform Deployment guide, which is good information. During your connection attempts, there is an issue with the connection from your SaaS instance and you're getting an error returned "Connection was successful. Unable to resolve service version."

After reviewing some information internally, this error appears to be misleading. Currently, the above error message will display, even if we don't actually successfully connect to the Artifactory instance. In past instances with this error, customers found that there was a slight issue with the URL being provided, and modifying it to the correct URL resolved the issue. We have an internal JIRA (JFUI-6895) logged to change the error text to more properly represent what is actually happening during the connection failure.

An important note here is that the SaaS instance needs to have web access to the Artifactory on-prem server. If you're using an internal hostname or have the Artifactory instance behind a reverse proxy, the Artifactory instance needs to be accessible through the web. The Artifactory SaaS instance will not have access to your internal network, so the reverse proxy will need to be accessible outside of your internal network.

If your on-prem instance is hosted on AWS, then you can use the AWS PrivateLink<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Setting+up+AWS+PrivateLinks#SettingupAWSPrivateLinks-Overview> guide to link your AWS VPC to the JFrog PrivateLink, which should allow for two way traffic between the two instances.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the information I provided above.

Regarding the replication, we have a very descriptive white paper<https://jfrog.com/whitepaper/replication-using-artifactory-to-manage-binaries-across-multi-site-topologies> that describes all forms of replication that Artifactory supports. The paper is long, but is very detailed and should help you with understanding each of the replication modes, as well as how to implement them between your instances. Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions related to this as well.

I look forward to working with you on this issue, please let me know how else I can assist.

Best regards,
Andrew Grosskurth

Thank you for getting back to me.

Since we had noticed some different behavior for the maven and docker repositories, I want to address each one separately, starting with the Maven repository.

The Maven repository was the one that we had discussed last.

As I had mentioned in a previous email, our developers reviewed the provided information and were unable to understand why the package was not being reindexed on force reindexing as there were no errors in the logs from that process. They did however note the following from the initial scan when the package was deployed.

I went ahead and reviewed this with a senior engineer on my team and have been told it is possible that there might be an issue with the metadata in the Maven repository.

They have asked that you try the following.

1. Recalculate the maven repository index and metadata using the REST API for Artifactory, then try to force reindex using the Xray REST API as done on the call again once the recalculation processes are complete

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-CalculateMavenIndex

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Xray+REST+API#XrayRESTAPI-ForceReindex

2. If the above fails, try to run the following curl from the Xray server, to check if it can find the Artifact (using BPSScheduler as the example from our call).

curl -u admin:<password> http://localhost:8046/artifactory/nextgen-release-local/com/twc/bps/SANETAD_4492_xray01/Common/CommonBusinessServices/BPSScheduler/BPSStubs-0.0.1.jar


Regarding the docker repository, on our initial call, we had discovered that images which were not being indexed were pulled using the for <art url>/library/<image>:<tag> instead of <art url>/<image>:<tag> or that they had been copied from another repository. Does either of these apply to these Docker images?

Ah, the frontend service is RED! When I looked at frontend-service.log, the last entry was from 17th. I see that you tried to start Artifactory today as the other logs show. Why isn't frontend even writing anything in the log?!

When was the last time you were able to login via UI? When did you upgrade MySQL to 5.7.34?

Can you try one more time by shutting down Artifactory, making sure that all the microservices stopped - there shouldn't be any pid files under <JFROG_HOME>/app/run directory, restart and see what happens?

Currently, we are POCing the following scenario:
We have a EC2 instance on AWS where we have installed JFrog CLI.We have a corn job on the EC2 instance that set to run every day at 1AMThe CLI command downloads log files from jfrog-log repo that were created in the last 24hWe have another cron job to extract logs from gz archive and placed them in the directory that splunk universal forwarder is monitoring.Splunk Universal forwarder is then sending the files content to splunkSince this is not the best way of using EC2 instance we were thinking on setting this up on a lambda scheduled to run once a day.Now that lambda would need to:download the files from jfrogstore them on S3 where we already have a mechanism that is responsible of sending them to Splunk ( not part of this discussion)
The lambda part is something that we are trying to investigate.To match what we do on EC2 intl lambda - getting logs using JFrog CLI we would need to have it installed every time we spin up lambda. You probably agree with me that CLI on lambda might not be the best choice.
Would you be able to help me figure out the best set of API calls to download artefacts created in last 24h ?THanks

No update from the other team.

I checked recent deploy activity. The problem still seems to exist.

I was that in a build which resulted in 24 deploys, 21 had the property correctly applied. However, the previous build only 9 out of 24 deploys had the correct property applied. In where the properties are not correctly applied always exists a sha256 property.

As discussed in the session today, user already exits will not be able to access the profile page even if you turn on the settings in LDAP settings. The only way to do this is by editing users settings ( we should avoid deleting the user as it will force a new apikey ). However, it's not feasible for the scope of all users.

To do this, we first tired to export user access data and modify the updatable_profile. However, the import process seems to be sticking or talking a long time.

A faster way would be to make direct changes to the database. As discussed, please take a db snapshot and ask your DBA to perform the following query:

SELECT user_id,prop_key,prop_value FROM access_users_custom_data as o where o.prop_key = 'updatable_profile';

UPDATE access_users_custom_data SET prop_value = true where prop_key='updatable_profile';

Let us know if your user can access profile pages after this. Thank you.

Adi,

I will try to get the support bundle from Primary-1.  I run into some issue with logging to the Kubernetes master node at the moment.

The NodePort config is due to the fact that the Kubernetes cluster underneath consists of VM instances in our own data center. We have no cloud load balancers in front of them.  What we have are Nginx servers that redirect traffic destined for a DNS name to the Kubernetes nodes at the port the Artifactory Nginx service bond to, e.g., 32008.

Hi Wei,

With respect to your questions

  *   In order to investigate it, please share with me the logs from Primary-1. (in the support bundle you shared, only the primary-0 logs are present)
  *   This is expected, if one instance is down, its license is considered not in use.
  *   This is expected, if the instance is down, its logs will not show in the UI. Regarding the message "Cannot read property ’data’ of undefined" please share with me the logs from Primary-1.
Furthermore, I have noticed that you have set the Nginx service type in the values.yaml file to 'NodePort', Are you running the cluster on Minikube? if not please remove this block



nginx:

  service:

    type: NodePort

For the spring-ws-core issue, it does look like you ran into this bug XRAY-7294 - "Files may not be indexed and other updates lost when RabbitMQ fails to receive messages that were resolved in 3.23.0". This most likely caused the build components to be mis-mapped and further builds would reuse this mis-mapping which was why the issue escaped the previous scan.

In your logs, I see that the last scan of the build (160) was before the upgrade (2021-10-08), and build 161 was after the upgrade (2021-10-26).

In Xray 3.26, there was an improvement made in the internal caching system that allows Xray to stop using the internal reuse mechanism which would allow for the remapping of the component allowing the build component to be remapped which was why this component was detected on build 161.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for joining me today.

During the session we were able to get xray up and running. However, during the db sync, the machine was running out of memory causing xray to go down. I can confirm that you can mount an ebs volume on opt/jfrog/xray/var. However, once you do so everything will get erased. You can move everything to tmp beforehand or just download fresh- up to you!

Thank you for the rabbitmq logs. However, they do not give much indication as to why the queue size is big. Please run the command: "rabbitmqctl list_queues" and send me the output. I would also need a fresh set of xray logs as well to see if there are any errors that could be causing the large rabbitmq queue size as well. You can send me your files with the following curl command:

The impact on user accounts were that the API keys no longer existed. We suspect the user accounts were deleted, resurrected, and synced to all servers.

I made the last change at around 11:25 PM UTC (November 29th). The changes added four Artifactory JPDs to the Mesh topology.

No Access federation instance names were added to the access federation setup. The Access federation was already configured in a Star topology with BOBCAT the source. All the other instance names were targets (TOUCAN, BEAR, COUGAR, HARE, LION, MARMOTTE, PANDA and Kangaroo) We had been operating this way for about 7 months.

The change was from a Star topology to Mesh. I first added TOUCAN, then BEAR, followed by HARE and MARMOTTE. Then I added COUGAR, LION, PANDA and Kangaroo.

-Stan

Hi Stanley,

Thanks for contacting JFrog Support.

When looking in the log bundles you have sent we don't see any errors regarding access federation.

To look into this further please specify the following:
- examples of users that were changed
- time and date of the access federation change
- access federation instance names that were added to the access federation setup

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Regarding the Docker repository that is not indexing, I came across another case recently where a customer's docker images had not been indexed because of the way they had been pushed.

Can you send me a screenshot of the docker repository expanded and the name of the images which were not indexed? (Partially expanded Maven repo for reference).

I have an issue with build numbering. 
It's a bit challenging to keep build numbers in Jenkins "stable" . We moved some builds to a new instance of Jenkins and the build numbers started from 1 again. 
This has caused an issue in Xray - so there are two docker images present under a build, one from the 1st instance of Jenkins and one from the second and so the results don't make sense (there are two sets of vulnerabilities). 
I was just wondering how other customers deal with this? We've thought of a few solutions, but were wondering what the best one is. 
1) Suffix the build numbers so they are like 1-jenkins-instance2) During a build in jenkins, check if the build exists and if it does, delete it, before uploading the new build . 3) Delete all the builds (not the artifacts!) and start again 
Do most customers keep builds for a long time? Perhaps we should be more aggressive getting rid of them ? 
Thank you,
Graham.

The exits code 137 does not indicate OOM. It means a kill signal is sent, so it could be expected with mongo if it does not have a proper exits logic. I will try to reproduce that.

One additional issue is that the debug logs rotate too fast. Even though we capture the entire log folder when the API is running, the logs inside don't have all the live tailing logs we see on the call today. To have the logs for further debug and to identify the timestamp of each step, I would need to ask you to collect the logs again and pipe them to a file and share with us:

tail -f xray_server.log | grep thea > thea_xray_server.log

tail -f xray_analysis.log | grep thea > thea_xray_analysis.log

As this is a standby session we will not be joining the meeting at the time listed but when you run into an issue you can alert us on this ticket and a resource will be made available to you to assist in the issue. Let me know if you have any questions.

Our Artifactory instance runs on a validated environment. In order to upgrade to a major version, we will have go through validation process, which can take around 6 weeks.
Fastest route is a patch version of 7.25, which can be quickly validated and deployed. Can you help with it.

Thanks,

Hi Srinivas,

There was no workaround found for the current version so looking to upgrade would be the best route.  Any progress on moving forward with an upgrade to 7.26.3?

Hey Sreenivas,

Thank you Jay for the introduction, I am moving Support to CC and then off this thread since this is a nonsupport related question.

Sreenivas, more than happy to help out with any questions revolving around your JFrog Subscription.  Looks like your 12 month grace period of SSO functionality expired and was recently removed.  How can I help out?

Best,

Nate

All sessions are between 1:00am and 6:00am in my local timezone, which isn’t practical for me. I would prefer to continue with email based support.

Also to be clear, the development environment is set up the same as the production environment. It fails after doing the upgrade on it though. We’re looking to migrate Xray to a different server now (both in dev and then production) so that the upgrade process works as documented in the future.

Actually, you should set the Nginx's external IP for shared.metrics.filebeat.elasticsearch.url

However, I could reproduce this issue on my end.  There was no information for JVM metrics.

When I set up Artifactory in non-k8s, I can see filebeat.log is written actively.

It seems to be a bug as I can't see filebeat.log in k8s env at all.

I"ll check internally if this is a bug or not.

Adi,

I will try to get the support bundle from Primary-1.  I run into some issue with logging to the Kubernetes master node at the moment.

The NodePort config is due to the fact that the Kubernetes cluster underneath consists of VM instances in our own data center. We have no cloud load balancers in front of them.  What we have are Nginx servers that redirect traffic destined for a DNS name to the Kubernetes nodes at the port the Artifactory Nginx service bond to, e.g., 32008.

Hi Wei,

With respect to your questions

  *   In order to investigate it, please share with me the logs from Primary-1. (in the support bundle you shared, only the primary-0 logs are present)
  *   This is expected, if one instance is down, its license is considered not in use.
  *   This is expected, if the instance is down, its logs will not show in the UI. Regarding the message "Cannot read property ’data’ of undefined" please share with me the logs from Primary-1.
Furthermore, I have noticed that you have set the Nginx service type in the values.yaml file to 'NodePort', Are you running the cluster on Minikube? if not please remove this block



nginx:

  service:

    type: NodePort

Subject: RE: [#187301] Checksum issues with NPM artifacts

Hi,

Thanks for looking into it. Unfortunately I don't think the problem is with the repository URL. For one, the dependency that fails is one out ~2000 that gets downloaded when running npm install and all others work. Secondly, the repo URL that's used correctly points to our virtual repo:

> npm config get registry
https://artifactory.deshaw.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm/

As was pointed out earlier in the thread, it looks like the URL to the tarball Artifactory has stored points to https://artifactory.deshaw.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm/ instead of the actual tarball location. That's different from any other remote dependency we've seen. Since that URL is incorrect, npm downloads 0 bytes, and tries to calculate its checksum against that, which of course doesn't match.

I'm happy to clear out the cache though and see if that works. We've been avoiding doing so, because it might lead to us not being able to troubleshoot / reproduce it again. Although it might fix this dependency, we want to make sure the same issue doesn't pop up again.

Subject: [#187301] Checksum issues with NPM artifacts


This message was sent by an external party.

Hi Harikishen,

Thank you for your patience.

Here are the steps I've taken in order to further investigate this issue.
1. Configured the npm client to use version 6.14 (any v6 should have the same issue you're describing)



> npm -v

6.14.4
2. Created an npm remote repository with the exact same settings as those used in your production instance by copying the xml in the Config Descriptor.
3. Resolved the following package from this remote repository:



npm i @babel/plugin-bugfix-safari-id-destructuring-collision-in-function-expression@7.16.2 --verbose
This completed successfully.

From this, we know that the repository settings you're using are working correctly and the issue lies somewhere else.

Afterwards, I delved deeper into the logs you provided and noticed something interesting in the request logs. When requesting the package, the response is getting a 404 error:



2021-11-30T02:52:54.956Z|e06d944bccdff3ca|10.219.66.97|hafiz|GET|/api/npm/@babel%2fplugin-bugfix-safari-id-destructuring-collision-in-function-expression|404|-1|0|28|npm/6.13.7 node/v12.22.1 linux x64
On my instance, the request appears as the following:



2021-11-30T19:12:11.790Z|85421ba2defe3d46|52.215.237.185|admin|GET|/api/npm/npm-remote/@babel%2fplugin-bugfix-safari-id-destructuring-collision-in-function-expression|304|-1|0|5|npm/6.14.12 node/v12.22.1 darwin x64
The main difference here is that your request doesn't include the name of the Artifactory repository that you're using to resolve the package. The request on the QA (working instance) includes the repository name and therefore succeeds:



2021-11-30T09:30:31.672Z|2fd5afa6f2265227|10.219.66.97|hosamana|GET|/api/npm/npm/@babel%2fplugin-bugfix-safari-id-destructuring-collision-in-function-expression|200|-1|0|186|npm/6.13.7 node/v12.22.1 linux x64

This shows me that the registry configuration for the Prod instance doesn't include the npm repository name. Please reconfigure the npm client with the instructions from the Set Me Up page in Artifactory and try to resolve the package again:
[Image removed by sender.]

Afterwards, please download the package again from Artifactory and share the results with me.

If the issue persists, please do the following:
- Delete the contents of the npm-remote cache
- Zap the cache from the npm-remote-cache
- Share with me the contents of you .npmrc file

I look forward to your update.

I’m sorry for the delay in response.
Please find my answers below for your queries in on binerystore.xml file.

1) Are both of theese config files are identical?

ANS: Yes, both the configurations are same and as detailed the expanded configurations will be looked as “”under the hood” one.

2) How can I speed up file transfer betwen hosts? Can i use multithreaded rsync or something similar to populate filestore?

ANS: In the first attempt we can increase the “max connection” values as defined in point (3) and observe for any improvement, if you are still noticing delay/lag in file transfer I would request you to provide the below details for further troubleshooting purposes.

3) If i add the <provider id> section to Binary Provider config like follows, will it be helpful to increase maxConnections value? How can i calculate the safe number of connections? For now i can't catch any activity similar to 200 counts, and replication of filestore is very slow.​​

ANS: setting up the provider id as mentioned will help set the values configured however as you might be aware the default “maxconnection” value is set to 200. There is no definite calculation to identify the ideal “maxconnection” value. As you have stated the replication is very slow we can try increasing the value gradually to higher values and monitor the status of replication/Artifactory Machines stability. In this way, we can overcome the slow replication on other hand ensure the stability of the Artifactory.

Please share with us the below details in case the issue with the delay in file transfer persists after making the above changes.

1) The current binerystore.xml configured.( after making changes)
2) Support bundle of both source and target Artifactory machines. This will help us to look for any possible failure entires.

You can send me the files using the following curl command. This will deploy them to our “Supportlogs” Artifactory SaaS instance:
curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/186744/"

I hope this information helps and I look forward to your response.

"However, can you please confirm if the Artifactory setup is HA or standalone. As mentioned before, in system.yaml you have enabled “haEnabled: true”, whereas from the screenshot you have shared it seems to be a standalone instance(Status Offline 0 of 1 nodes)."
Yes, we are working on the high availability, therefore the haEnabled is true. But this is in progress, which is why you are seeing a standalone isntance.

Thanks for the info. So it’s only fixed in versions after 7.7, not any other new 6.x versions? And are there any other workaround except for using V2 feed? We’re encouraging people to use V3 feed since the nuget.org V2 feed is not reliable now.With this known issue it’s kind of hard to persuage people to move to using V3 feed. Our two main artifactory instances are still 6.x version, is there any workaround that can be leveraged so people can use V3 feed on 6.x version?
Thanks a lot.

  We made a decision to move only the storage to Google Cloud Storage for
now. This artifactory instance is on *6.23* and there is no plan to upgrade
this to ver 7.x*.*

  After reviewing RTF6X/ConfiguringtheFilestore-GoogleStorageBinaryProvider
<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF6X/Configuring+the+Filestore#ConfiguringtheFilestore-GoogleStorageBinaryProvider>,
I have follow up questions on the migration to GCS:

   1. Does Artifactory 6.23 also support the template "google-storage-v2" (
   JFROG/GoogleStorageBinaryProviderNativeClientTemplate
   <https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+the+Filestore#ConfiguringtheFilestore-GoogleStorageBinaryProviderNativeClientTemplate>)?
   I see documentation restricting to "google-storage" v1 template (JetS3t
   library library under the hood).
   2. Does Artifactory 6.23 also support *SignedUrlRedirect?*
   3. Can you point me to list of known issues from the v1
   template  (JetS3t) that are now resolved in v2 template (Native Client)
   4. Provide performance/load/stress testing numbers comparison between
   the v1 (JetS3t) and v2 (Native Client) templates for guidance.

Best,
Kishan

Hi Jayalakshmi,

Thank you for getting back to us.

I found the below links for the reported behaviour, where the issue occurred due to the main jar task being disabled by the Spring Boot application, and the component expects it to be present. This issue has been fixed in the Jenkins Artifactory plugin version  3.12.5<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Jenkins+Artifactory+Plug-in#JenkinsArtifactoryPlug-in-ReleaseNotes>, we would request you to upgrade the plugin to the latest version and test the behaviour.

Due to some internal issues, the upgrade was cancelled during the timeslots which are 7 PM to 9 PM EST. I apologize for that. As the latest version has some internal architectural changes, it will have some downtime and that is the reason why I did not want to go outside of the maintenance window to upgrade the instance.

Thank you for writing back to us.

I realized the path mentioned in the article is for Artifactory v6.x. Please consider the below path for the server.xml file in v7.x.

-rwxr-xr-x. 1 artifactory artifactory   1635 Nov 30 18:03 server.xml
[root@uma-zavika-art1 conf]# pwd
/opt/jfrog/artifactory/app/artifactory/tomcat/conf


and below is an example for increasing the connection timeout value for easy reference, Tomcat connection timeout to a very large value (for instance, 7200000 for 2 hours or -1 for infinite).

<Connector port="8081" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="7200000"/>

And restart Artifactory.

  1.  settings.xml file
  2.  pom.xml (it is taking from /opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build/pom.xm)

  4.   bitbucket-pipelines.yml file
  5.  If you have any sample project and if you use a similar command jfrog rt mvn -B release:clean release:prepare for that project does the behavior is same? This helps us to know if the issue is with the plugin version or the pipeline

Thank you for the reply. I tried the same use case on my end and noticed a similar behaviour where the 'Preview' action displays '0 Artifacts' as the number of artifacts that will be archived using the policy. Whereas the REST API call returns expected results.

As a next step, I opened an internal Jira RTDEV-25288 and marked the Jira for a product review, and prioritize accordingly.

Please let me know if you have any follow up queries, I'll be glad to assist you.
Looking forward to your comments.

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

Regarding the issue reported while resolving artifacts from virtual repositories, we would like to get the following details before scheduling a web session to discuss further.
1. Did you start seeing this behavior all of sudden or is there any recent configuration change or upgrade activity performed in the current environment?
2. Provide the details about what are the repositories configured in virtual and details of artifacts you have in both remote and local repositories.
3. Does this behavior is occurring for a specific package or all the packages.
4. Please describe more details about the statement "virtual repo is not able to download the correct version of local repo". Does it mean, while downloading an artifact, the correct version is not being downloaded from the local repository?
5. What is the expected behavior and what is happening currently while resolving artifacts from the virtual repository.
6. Reproduce the issue again and collect the client output and Artifactory support bundle for further debugging.

You may upload files using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:
$ curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187372/"
*No username and password are required for the upload.

Looking forward to your reply.

Thanks for your patience.

Regarding your query about the index of deb/RPM remote repositories, the index should be calculated by default. As you have mentioned that the index of deb/RPM remote repositories can't be pulled successful, please elaborate the use case in details about the issue which will help us to understand the scenario better. Please provide us the Artifactory support bundle and client logs after reproducing the issue for further debugging.

You may upload files using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:
$ curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187386/"
*No username and password are required for the upload.

Currently, we do not have a mechanism to stop the background tasks and the only option is restart the Artifactory application. We can block replications globally or at the repository level as per our requirement.

Looking forward to your reply.

We are having issues with the official deployment method for JFrog Xray using Docker Compose and setup scripts provided by JFrog.

We are following the deployment documentation below:
https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Installing+Artifactory#InstallingArtifactory-DockerComposeInstallation
https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Installing+Xray#InstallingXray-DockerComposeInstallation

Versions we are targeting for deployment:
https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/artifactory-pro/org/artifactory/pro/docker/jfrog-artifactory-pro/7.27.6/
https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-xray/xray-compose/3.33.3/

The issue we are seeing is that JFrog Xray (Hosted on VM 2 using docker/docker-compose) tries to communicate to JFrog Artifactory (Hosted on VM 1 using docker/docker-compose) using a Docker NAT IP Address that only Exists on VM 1.
This causes the JFrog Router container to fail within the docker compose deployment for JFrog Xray.
The deployment bash scripts resolve JFrog Artifactory/platform IP address and port without issues, the issue only arises when JFrog router sources the isolated ‘Docker NAT’ IP address of the Artifactory/platform container hosted internal to the external host virtual machine.

We need a direction forward with the compose deployment solution to get JFrog Xray to communicate with JFrog Artifactory/Platform for security scanning integration but the supported and provided documentation from JFrog does not seem to work.

Please advise and if you require further information, please let me know or to organise a remote support call.


Kind Regards,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.
As the upgrade from 6.x version to 7.x version involves the introduction of additional microservices to the environment and a few minor changes to the reverse proxy configuration (if any), I request you to share with us the current architecture information of the environment.
For example: Load balancer, Reverse Proxy, Standalone/HA instance.

I am currently testing the upgrade path from Artifactory version 6.16 to the latest version. Meanwhile, could you please share with us the above requested information which will help us to revert with the required details accordingly?

Thank you for reaching JFrog Support.

My name is Aashish Singh and I will be assisting you with this case.

With regards to your query regarding configuration of Artifactory on Mission control as you have mentioned it is still trying to resolve old IP addresses.

You have to make sure that the Jfrog URL and Join.key should be configured properly on the mission control system.yaml file.

jfrogUrl - URL to the machine where JFrog Artifactory is deployed, or the load balancer pointing to it. It is recommended to use DNS names rather than direct IPs. For example: http://jfrog.acme.com or http://10.20.30.40:8082
Set it in the Shared Configurations section of the $JFROG_HOME/mc/etc/system.yaml file.
join.key - This is the "secret" key required by Artifactory for registering and authenticating the Mission Control server.
You can fetch the Artifactory joinKey (join Key) from the JPD UI in the Administration module | Security | Settings | Join Key.
Set the join.key  used by your Artifactory server in the Shared Configurations section of the  $JFROG_HOME/mc/etc/system.yaml file.

In mission control properties please check the insight URL where exactly it is pointing.

# =================
# Insight
#==================
# insight.url=http://localhost:8088

Click on the link to get more information about the properties setting.

If you are sure all these parameters are configured correctly and nothing is left, please consider rebooting Mission Control. This will remove any temporary configuration if any exists in the system and put new configuration in place.

Please give it a try and let me know the outcome.

Aashish Singh

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.
I parsed through the shared logs, I could see multiple Read timed out error. In order to further investigate the reported issue, I would like to gather a few more details from you.

1. From when you have started observing this issue? Do you see any spike in the resource utilization for Artifactiory?

2. Do you have a reverse proxy configured in front of the Artifactory? If yes, do you see any error in the reverse proxy logs? Once the step 2 and 3 is performed,  zip the error.log and share it with us.

3.  Enable the debug logger for maven.

<logger name="org.artifactory.maven">
<level value="debug"/>
</logger>

The above logger should go to $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/var/etc/artifactory/logback.xml file. No restart is required for the changes to take effect.

NOTE: Debug loggers are resource-intensive, once the issue is reproduced, remove the debug logger.

4. Reproduce the issue again, share the output of the maven clean install output with the debug option -X enabled.

5. Once step 3 and step 4 is performed, let us know the filename, Artifactory user-name, and the exact stamp of the issue and then generate a new support bundle and share it with us.

You may upload your files using a cURL command to deploy them to our Artifactory SaaS instance:

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187395/"

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for providing your inputs.  Since you are able to perform the ‘dotnet restore’ directly using the build agent ( which I believe is the direct dotnet client ), I  suspect the issue is happening only in the docker container setup. Could you please clarify to us that do we perform dotnet restore using JFrog CLI in your build agent / dotnet client?

Also, from the previous session, I do observe that you are using the specific docker commands to run the dotnet as the docker container. Could you please share the exact command for running the dotnet as a docker container and how to run the dotnet restore in the docker container with us? So that we can try the same from our end.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
Regarding the first limitation you mentioned, yes you are right. I see that when we use  "*npm*" and "*gav*"as regular expression individually it is working fine.
Here are two example Xray reports with the above two regular expressions.


















Regarding the second limitation,  I have checked the Xray report you shared and it contains alpine, Maven and generic package types. In order to investigate further, is it possible you can share the sample docker image with us which helps us to test the same at our end or the docker file you are using and see if we get the same results?
If possible, please share the docker image in archive format using docker save. You may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:

curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187366/"

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to the issue that you are facing, if I am understanding it correctly, you are triggering this Rest API multiple times and getting a timeout.

Can you kindly share the below information with us in order to debug further -

1. Share the build name and build number for which it is failing.

2. Share the time when the issue occurred along with the time zone.

3. Can you please confirm where are you defining the smaller timeout? Also, can you please elaborate on which quota are you talking about here?

4. You have mentioned that "it fails in timeout after 6 hours (I then define a much smaller timeout to not reach the quota)!!!". So basically, the Rest API works for 6 hours and after every 6 hours, it fails?

5. Are there any concurrent requests being triggered for deleting the same build?

Please share the above information with us. I will be waiting for your response.

Best regards,

Thank you for the response.
From the shared error snippet,  it looks like one of the microservices of Xray is unable to register with the router service,

2021-11-30T15:09:31.059Z ESC[33m[jfxid]ESC[0m ESC[34m[INFO ]ESC[0m [        ] [access_client_bootstrap:167  ] [main        ] (--wrapper--)Cluster join: Retry 55: Service registry ping failed, will retry. Error: Error while trying to connect to local router at address 'http://localhost:8046/access': Get "http://localhost:8046/access/api/v1/system/ping": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8046: connect: connection refused

As a next step, please check on the below points:

1. Go to $XRAY_HOME/var/etc/system.yaml and check if you have added the shared.node.ip as shown below:

shared:
    node:
        ip: <XRAY_HOST_IP>

In addition to that, please check the Artifactory system.yaml and add the shared.node.ip (host ip address where Artifactory is running) entry in the system.yaml of Artifactory. This step is to ensure there are network issue.

2. Please check if the ipv6 is enabled in the host machine where you are trying to install the Xray. If yes, try to disable the IPV6 at the server level, for example on how to disable IPV6 on Redhat/centos you could refer to the external link or you can comment out or remove the IPV6 section under /etc/hosts file. Then try install the Xray.

3. Login to the Xray machine and navigate to the $JFROG_HOME/xray/app/bin/diagnostics directory and execute the following command which will help us to identify the status of all ports related to Xray. Please share the complete output for our analysis.

./diagnosticsUtil run diagnostics.yaml

Please check the system requirement page of Xray and you need to enable all the mentioned ports for Xray.

4. From our past experience, we have seen the "connection refused" error due to the proxy/network issue.  Please validate if you have any proxy or firewall between the Artifactory and Xray servers. Run the following command and share the output with us.

lsof -I:<port>

If the issue still persists, after checking on the above points, we can join the live session at 10 AM  GMT+1 on Friday to troubleshoot the issue further.

Looking forward to your response.

Subject: [External] [#186817] Artifactory cannot startup with AWS IMDSv2

Hi Minmin,

Thank you for your patience.
I have checked further and found that you can use IMDSv2 with the "s3-storage-v3" binary provider.
The "s3-storage-v3" template uses AWS SDK and consumes identity credentials<https://clicktime.symantec.com/3VF2MEUSrfQRxMso79xyJWf6xn?u=https%3A%2F%2Fobjectivefs.com%2Fhowto%2Fhow-to-get-amazon-s3-keys>.



<identity>Access_key_ID</identity>

<credential>Secret_access_key</credential>
If you would like to use the IAM role instead, you can use the flag "<useInstanceCredentials>true</useInstanceCredentials>". For example,



    <provider type="s3-storage-v3" id="s3-storage-v3">

        <bucketName></bucketName>

        <endpoint></endpoint>

        <signatureExpirySeconds>600</signatureExpirySeconds>

        <region></region>

        <roleName>XXXXXX</roleName>

        <useInstanceCredentials>true</useInstanceCredentials>

    </provider>
This will allow the s3-storage-v3 binary provider to pick up the IAM role credentials associated with the EC2 instance. More information on the configuration of the filestore can be found here<https://clicktime.symantec.com/3kvje3rLa8nfAbXqt3Wjwh6xn?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fconfluence%2Fdisplay%2FJFROG%2FConfiguring%2Bthe%2BFilestore%23ConfiguringtheFilestore-AmazonS3OfficialSDKTemplate>.
As you're using the cluster binary provider, please refer to this template<https://clicktime.symantec.com/35t8LR27BeXg8p3tbdtiUus6xn?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fconfluence%2Fdisplay%2FJFROG%2FConfiguring%2Bthe%2BFilestore%23ConfiguringtheFilestore-AmazonS3SDKClusterBinaryProvider> to make the necessary changes.

I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have further questions and I'll be glad to assist you.

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to the reported issue on time difference in artifactory-request.log, from the received Support bundle, I went through the artifactory-request.log of the two nodes they are starting from 2021-11-30T12:48:07.240Z ". Unfortunately did not find any difference hence, we would like to capture a few more details in order to investigate the issue further.

-> Please let us know if you are using any log monitoring application such as Splunk or elastic search in which you are noticing this behavior?

-> If the issue is observed within the Artifactory application logs, could you please share with us a few example snippets with the exact timestamp and the support bundle from the time when the issue occurred.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to your query, we have reproduced the similar behaviour in our lab environment. We can connect to Xray from Visual studio code by using username/password via JFrog extension. Obviously we cannot connect using SAML username/password. Instead you can use a JFrog access token as well to connect Xray from Visual studio code.

Thank you for joining the session with us yesterday.

Over the session, we further verified the system configurations and could notice that the Artifactory was still configured to use the default configurations. Hence, we applied the tuning parameters based on the recommendations suggested on our confluence page

While checking the default file, we did observe, both JAVA_OPTS and CATALINA_OPTS is set with Xmx and Xms arguments, hence, after further checking in our lab, we could confirm that the CATALINA_OPTS is not required and we commented out the parameter

On the server.xml file, we updated the maxThreads for port 8081 with 500 and maxThreads for the port with 8040 with 150 and also updated the artifactory.system.properties with artifactory.access.client.max.connections = 150

Also, increased the corePool values and queuesize with the below parameters, this will help to define the number of background processes that can run in parallel and also queue the processes.
artifactory.async.corePoolSize = 32
artifactory.async.poolMaxQueueSize = 30000

Further, since we are unsure about the max_connections values configured on the database, we did not attempt to perform a restart of the server as we updated the db.properties with "pool.max.active = 300"

Hence, please confirm if the database can accept 300 connections and then perform a restart of Artifactory and share us with the observation.

I will look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you for joining the session with us. Over the session, we were able to overcome the issue with spool.dat file permissions by having the below configurations

global:
  customInitContainersBegin: |
   - name: "custom-setup"
     image: "{{ .Values.initContainerImage }}"
     imagePullPolicy: "{{ .Values.imagePullPolicy }}"
     securityContext:
       runAsUser: 0
       capabilities:
         drop:
           - NET_RAW
     command:
       - 'sh'
       - '-c'
       - 'if [ -e "{{ .Values.xray.persistence.mountPath }}/log/filebeat/spool.dat" ]; then chmod 600 {{ .Values.xray.persistence.mountPath }}/log/filebeat/spool.dat; fi'
     volumeMounts:
       - mountPath: "{{ .Values.xray.persistence.mountPath }}"
         name: data-volume


Further, we could see that the indentations on the values file were not as recommended, hence we agreed to test with the exact same values file and will update on the status of the preferred values file syntax that could be used at your end

I will get back to you with an update by EOD tomorrow.

Subject: Re: [#186709] CocoaPods Remote Repository - doesn't work for all github repos

Hello Jakub,

Thank you for your response.
Reviewing the logs sent to me I don't see any request for BoringSSL.
I do see the other requests for the two packages shared, in Artifactory request.log.

I would like us to meet via zoom session to further review this issue and work to resolve it.
Kindly use the link below to setup a session.

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to the reported error, the Binary provider has no content error, this behavior is described in a Knowledge Base article, where there are a couple of different scenarios that can cause this behavior (binarystore.xml misconfiguration or a conflict with the backup and artifact manipulation tasks). Please review the article provided for more information on how to resolve this issue.

If the issue persists after performing the steps recommended, please share with us the complete support bundle from both source/target Artifactory to go through for any possible failure entries which will help us for further troubleshooting.

You can send me the files using the following curl command. This will deploy them to our “Supportlogs” Artifactory SaaS instance:
curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187399/"


I look forward to your feedback.

Thank you for sharing more information on this.

From your explanation, I understand that your use case is you would just like to get your packages scanned and keep them there. Later when you would like to block anything you will be enabling the policy and blocking them.

In that case, you do not have to do any extra steps here. Whenever you push a new package to any repository and if that repository is part of "Indexed Resources" and if the repository is 100% indexed, then the packages that are there in the repository are scanned. You do not need to add the repository to any watch or policy to get the packages scanned. You need to make the repositories part of the watch or policy when you would like to apply some specific rules such as if you would like to catch only critical vulnerabilities etc.

For example, I have a repository named "k-maven-local" where I have pushed a jar file named "commons-codec-1.2.jar" as below -



Now, I have included this repository in the "Indexed Resources" section as shown below and made sure the repository shows 100% there -



Now when I search the jar file in the UI, it will take me to the repository where it is deployed and in the Xray tab where you will be able to see the vulnerability if any as shown below -




Please let me know if this suffices your use case. You can also get more details from this link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf3iKXMpr68.

Please let me know if you have any queries. I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for writing back to us.

I have discussed with my colleagues and understood that the mechanism of helm repo is different when compared to docker repository, which is why the sub-domain method will not accommodate helm repositories.

I would request you to use the below endpoint while configuring remote/virtual repositories and advise if this helps to overcome the issue with helm show  command.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
With regards to the connection refused issue, It looks like Mission Control and Distribution container are not able to connect to Artifactory via this URL (http://jfrog.asux.690318431897.awscnaptiv.com/) and that is the reason we get below timeout messages.

Error: Get "http://jfrog.asux.690318431897.awscnaptiv.com/access/api/v1/system/ping": dial tcp 172.22.155.228:80: i/o timeout
last error: Get "http://jfrog.asux.690318431897.awscnaptiv.com/access/api/v1/system/ping": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
last error: Get "http://jfrog.asux.690318431897.awscnaptiv.com/access/api/v1/system/ping": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)

As a next step, if possible can you please check whether the below REST API is working fine in Mission Control and Distribution container.

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-access-token>" http://jfrog.asux.690318431897.awscnaptiv.com/access/api/v1/system/ping

In the above command, the <admin-access-token> can be generated from Artifactory as shown below.







In the above REST API test, if you get the same timeout error then please check with the network team on this connectivity issue between Mission Control, Distribution and Artifactory using http://jfrog.asux.690318431897.awscnaptiv.com/ URL.

Also, I would like to know whether all the JFrog applications like, Artifactory, Mission Control, Distribution are deployed in the same network/cluster?

Looking forward to your response.

Can you please make sure the user token has valid permission to deploy/cache on jcenter-maven-remote repository. As the below log message complaints about permission issue in the logs. Please make sure the permission is added and let me know if the issue is resolved. If not please share the occurrence of the issue which helps us to compare the timestamp of the issue in Artifactory logs.

2021-11-29T16:02:31.585Z [jfrt ] [WARN ] [41b148927110d7f8] [.r.ArtifactoryResponseBase:136] [ttp-nio-8081-exec-31] - Sending HTTP error code 403: Failed to transform pom file: User token:sonic-financial-integrations is not permitted to deploy 'org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin/3.0.0-M5/maven-surefire-plugin-3.0.0-M5.pom' into 'jcenter-maven-remote-cache:org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin/3.0.0-M5/maven-surefire-plugin-3.0.0-M5.pom'.

I believe the system property mentioned by Harish is not required for now, as we do not see any DENIED LOGIN's for the user token sonic-financial-integrations.
Looking forward to your update.

It appears that you have run into an issue described in this RTFACT-20557 Jira, in which in some cases when the Nuget upstream is inaccessible, the requests result in a timeout and a 404 instead of serving the requested packages from the cache. This behavior is fixed in the next Artifactory release, expected to be released by the end of this year. You may follow the release notes page to stay updated with the exact release with the fix.
I hope you will find this information useful. please let me know if you have any questions, I will gladly assist.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to the reported behavior on helm repositories, the instance (“empirixartifactory”) was recently upgraded to the latest version (on 28/12).

Moving forward, we agreed that you would work with your colleagues to use the JFrog configurations . Please update the Artifactory K8s instance accordingly and update me on the result of the conan upload afterwards.

I look forward to your update.

Best regards,

Thank you for getting back to us.

1. Are you observing the reported issue when accessing the Artifactory using the Load balancer URL? Or the issue is observed only when accessing one of the Artifactory nodes?

2. Go to the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/var/data/artifactory/filestore and check if you are able to locate the sha value of the artifact for which the download is failing?

3. If you are observing the issue with the secondary node, did you perform the rsync from primary to secondary as suggested in the earlier session? Do you still see the NFS mount issue in the secondary node.

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Andreas,


Typically a forbidden error means that your user does not have proper permissions to execute a given task. Is the artifactory user that you are providing in the script an admin user? The plugin requires a valid admin user for artifactory in order to run it.


If your user is an admin, please send screenshots of the user's permission in artifactory along with a support bundle that has been generated after the issue has been reproduced. You can send me your files with the following curl command:

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/186156/"

here is the structure of our former Disaster Recovery Instance (V6.19.0 ) which is no longer in use because V7.x  don't support this.
It was a standard V6.x installation and worked for 2 years without problems.
root@production-dr.artifactory ~ > ll /opt/jfrog/artifactory/
total 0
drwxrwxr-x 4 root        root        325 Apr 29  2020 bin/

drwxrwxr-x 2 root        root         47 Apr 29  2020 webapps/

And here is the structure from the QA system before the upgrade:

drwxr-xr-x  9 artifactory artifactory 4096 May 28  2021 var/

This is the structure of one of our Production nodes (V7.12.6):
root@production1.artifactory artifactory > ll

drwxr-xr-x 13 artifactory artifactory 166 May  6  2021 app/

drwxr-xr-x  9 artifactory artifactory  98 May  6  2021 var/

Both systems were installed with a 5.x version about 4 years ago and then upgraded all the time. They are working until now.

It seems for me that the upgrade script has problems with that structure now?
I don't think that it make sense now to reproduce the migration path V6.x --> V7.x, but more to analyse the current upgrade of a V7.x system with this
permission structure which is obviously used since a long time without problems.
I checked all our migrated systems and on all these systems at least the /opt/jfrog/artifactory/etc/ folder has owner root:root. They are all working fine.

But I fear that we will have trouble with an upgrade on all these systems.

I will go to restore the VMware snapshot and manually "correct" the permissions and then try the upgrade again.

Hi Artur,

Does the package still show up in the UI and conda install command still work? The message doesn't seem to indicate that it is an error and look at past cases, it looks like this can be ignored.

Subject: [#186856] Could not propagate changes to another access server:

CAUTION: This message is from an external sender
Hi Bram,

Thank you for the information.

Going over the REST API call outputs, I can see that as suspected, the Router microservice of "tubby-lusty" has a problematic configuration which considers the address of "qualm-state" to be localhost.



$ cat router_routes_tubby-lusty.log | grep "jfrt_" -A 4

            "name": "jfrt_01fhr1q2axms8v0maqhxfh1gar-qualm-state",

            "load_balancer_method": "wrr",

            "servers": [

                {

                    "url": "http://172.30.12.45:8082",

--

            "name": "jfrt_01fhr1q2axms8v0maqhxfh1gar-tubby-lusty",

            "load_balancer_method": "wrr",

            "servers": [

                {

                    "url": "http://172.30.12.42:8082",

--

            "name": "jfrt_01fhr1q2axms8v0maqhxfh1gar-qualm-state-0",

            "load_balancer_method": "wrr",

            "servers": [

                {

                    "url": "http://localhost:8081",



 $ cat router_routes_qualm-state.log | grep "jfrt_" -A 4

            "name": "jfrt_01fhr1q2axms8v0maqhxfh1gar-qualm-state-0",

            "load_balancer_method": "wrr",

            "servers": [

                {

                    "url": "http://localhost:8081",

--

            "name": "jfrt_01fhr1q2axms8v0maqhxfh1gar-tubby-lusty",

            "load_balancer_method": "wrr",

            "servers": [

                {

                    "url": "http://172.30.12.42:8082",

While this example includes the "jfrt" microservices, it takes place for other microservices as well.

The interesting thing is that there are two entries for "qualm-state", called "qualm-state" and "qualm-state-0". While I'm unsure what caused the duplication, my guess is that "qualm-state-0" was created second following upgrade/maintenance, as it's the problematic one.

I believe our current approach should be resetting the Router configuration of "tubby-lusty" and checking if the issue would be resolved upon startup.

As I need to consult R&D regarding this (who are probably asleep by now), I will reach out to you tomorrow with the exact instructions.

I assume it's expected, since the primary node is responsible for more tasks than other nodes, GC for example isn't performed by the secondary nodes in this architecture.
Other tasks are backups, archive indexing, communication, and sending events to Xray (you do not use it so it's irrelevant in your case).
Replications in the past could be done only by the primary, but that's not the case today.

The Eden barely cross the 8 GB and after each GC I believe it drops below 4 GB, but we should take a look at this graph in hours/days so we can observe how it behaves with more GC runs and during full GC (which happens after every 20 partial GC by default) and GC runs every 4 hours unless you have changed it.

As for the heap histograms - I do not see issues in them as well.

I see you are in a new version of Artifactory, what stopping you from moving to the cloud-native architecture? Basically, you won't need to be dependent on a single node to perform the above tasks, so every node will be capable of doing it (task affinity).

Error messages from VS Code extension did not point much towards the reason why we are unable to assign Xray URL to VS Code. And they are more generic in nature.

I am glad to hear that you were able to configure the replication.
In order to disable the Replicator in your Artifactory, you need to remove the replicator section from system.yaml (as you did already).

Additionally, you need to clear Router cache data related to the Replicator service.
Please navigate to Artifactory home directory, and delete all the cache files related to the Replicator service in the Router data directory, those files are named "jfxfer" and can be found under $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/data/router/local/services directory.
After deleting the "jfxfer" files, please restart Artifactory, the Router will reload without Replicator service.
Please let me know if it resolved the displayed warning message.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for sharing the details.

Thank you for contacting JFrog support.

My name is Or Naishtat and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

Regarding your inquiry about bad MD5 value, this behavior occurs when the RPM client expects a specific value from the package repository however the calculated value is different, this could occur due to multiple reasons such as metadata issues in the repository or corrupted downloads, kindly elaborate on the following information for further investigation:
- Elaborate on the workflow and how/when this behavior interacts with Artifactory.
- Does this behavior occur for specific packages, or on a specific repository?
- Does the calculated value match with the MD5 values displayed in Artifactory?

Looking forward to your update.

Hi Andreas,

Thank you for replying back.

Upon further discussion with the Xray team, it appears that deadlocks are expected and that there is a retry mechanism that should overcome these deadlocks.

In addition, I would like to better understand if you are experiencing any issues with Xray's performance as a result?

Hi Jörgen,

Thank you for sharing the details, I have further tried in my lab and found the reason behind the issue. This is because of the license file having multiple licenses and as a next step I would recommend you take a back of the artifactory.cluster.license files and then remove all the content and empty the license file from both the nodes. Perform a restart after that and check the status from the License Bucket page. By now we should observe the number of licenses should be 2 if not, we can directly connect to the Artifactory database and remove the buckets from the mc_bucket table and then add the bucket and attach the license again.

Please share me the status and your observations, if you still face any issues we will hop on another session to fix it.
Will be looking forward to your response.

From our previous experience, we have seen this behavior due to a few special characters in the repository names or in POM File or due to a few malfunctioning remote repositories being included in the Virtual repository.  Looking into the error stack trace, I believe one of the remote repositories is causing this behavior.

In order to identify the concerned remote repository, I would request you to perform the below test cases and let us know the outcome of it.  Please ensure " Allow Content Browsing " option is enabled on the remote repositories which are involved in this testing.

Test case -1 :

1. Create a new virtual repository and include only the remote repositories which are present in ws-repo.

2. Expand the newly created virtual repository or click on Native Browser on the virtual repository

Test case - 2:

1. Expand each remote repositories present in ws-repo or click on Native Browser on each of the remote repositories and let us know in which repository we are receiving ‘404’ errors as below:



We look forward to your feedback.

After our changes, it seems I see no longer error "the uncommitted block count cannot exceed the maximum limit of 100,000 blocks". Same time I see that big files are being replicated too. Based on the Repository storage trend, it grew by 10 Tb in 2 days. I guess it had to take some time to GC to get cleaned up uncommitted blocks after I increased size.

However, I started to see different error:

Thank you for the email.
Please increase the timeout and Maxthread values in the Artifactory where the pull replications are configured. Below are the default and the tunning example. The changes have to be made in the server.xml file under the tomcat configuration folder ( $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/tomcat/conf).

Default values:
<Connector port="8081" sendReasonPhrase="true" relaxedPathChars='[]' relaxedQueryChars='[]' maxThreads="200" connectionTimeout="60000"/>
<Connector port="8040" sendReasonPhrase="true" maxThreads="50"/>

Tuning example:
<Connector port="8081" sendReasonPhrase="true" relaxedPathChars='[]' relaxedQueryChars='[]' maxThreads="1024" connectionTimeout="180000"/>
<Connector port="8040" sendReasonPhrase="true" maxThreads="250"/>

Connector port="8081" is for Artifactory, Connector port="8040" is for Access.
When updating the Access maxThreads, it is required to update the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/artifactory.system.properties file with:
artifactory.access.client.max.connections = <VALUE>

Note: Restart of Artifactory is required after performing the above changes.

Thank you for your time explaining the issue in detail during the web session. We have started the call with a discussion about the advantages of using the Nginx server with the Artifactory instance.

You have explained the service implementation in detail and the current issue. We suspected the issue to be with the Nginx internal redirection initially and verified the Artifactory-Nginx configuration file. It appeared to be clean with the default configuration from the deployment template.

So, we have decided to focus on the deployment file values.yaml where we have observed the default internal redirection 80 -> 8080 in place. We have also observed that the SSL offloading is disabled at the Nginx level. As we have the SSL offloading being performed at the Nginx layer, we have enabled the SSL offload tag to "true" which in turn updated the Nginx configuration by removing the $server_port definition from the JFrog-Override-Base-Url header.



After this change, the Nginx pod has been re-initialised automatically and we were able to observe no port references from the UI now.

Thank you for your cooperation. We would mark this support case as closed as per the confirmation over the call. If any further assistance is needed in the future, you may always reach out to JFrog Support.

There is no firewall/router between xray and artifactory.
All ports are open.
However your xray requirement page is not clear at all about what ports are required for xray to talk to artifactory.

I made the modifications your said, restarted artifactory and xray but xray won't start up.

Objet : [#187079] need your help installing XRay via Debian package and recommended script

Hi Patrice,

Thank you for the response.
From the shared error snippet,  it looks like one of the microservices of Xray is unable to register with the router service,

2021-11-30T15:09:31.059Z ESC[33m[jfxid]ESC[0m ESC[34m[INFO ]ESC[0m [        ] [access_client_bootstrap:167  ] [main        ] (--wrapper--)Cluster join: Retry 55: Service registry ping failed, will retry.

As a next step, please check on the below points:

1. Go to $XRAY_HOME/var/etc/system.yaml<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Xray+System+YAML> and check if you have added the shared.node.ip as shown below:



shared:

    node:

        ip: <XRAY_HOST_IP>
In addition to that, please check the Artifactory system.yaml and add the shared.node.ip (host ip address where Artifactory is running) entry in the system.yaml of Artifactory. This step is to ensure there are network issue.

2. Please check if the ipv6 is enabled in the host machine where you are trying to install the Xray. If yes, try to disable the IPV6 at the server level, for example on how to disable IPV6 on Redhat/centos you could refer to the external link<https://www.thegeekdiary.com/centos-rhel-7-how-to-disable-ipv6/> or you can comment out or remove the IPV6 section under /etc/hosts file. Then try install the Xray.

3. Login to the Xray machine and navigate to the $JFROG_HOME/xray/app/bin/diagnostics directory and execute the following command which will help us to identify the status of all ports related to Xray. Please share the complete output for our analysis.



./diagnosticsUtil run diagnostics.yaml

Please check the system requirement page<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/System+Requirements> of Xray and you need to enable all the mentioned ports for Xray.

4. From our past experience, we have seen the "connection refused" error due to the proxy/network issue.  Please validate if you have any proxy or firewall between the Artifactory and Xray servers. Run the following command and share the output with us.



lsof -I:<port>

If the issue still persists, after checking on the above points, we can join the live session at 10 AM  GMT+1 on Friday to troubleshoot the issue further.

Looking forward to your response.

I did the following:

Stopped both nodes.
copied /sb/sys/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/artifactory.cluster.license
To artifactory.cluster.license.Bkup
Removed artifactory.cluster.license And re-created an empty file.
Tried to start.

This is the contents of mc_managed_license, should I delete all those lines?

After the root cause is confirmed, we will most likely switch redirection

Please let me know when exactly you plan to perform maintenance so I can
send an update internally about the downtime.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.


This error is encountered either when Artifactory and Xray are incompatible or due to misconfigurations.

Please share with me Artifactory’s version.

In addition, please verify that the Xray base URL in the Config Descriptor is correct.
To do so you  should navigate to  Admin → Settings → Artifactory → Advanced → Config Descriptor and verify that the URL is configured  as below:

<baseUrl>http://localhost:8046/xray</baseUrl>

If this is not the configured URL,  please update it accordingly.

If you still encounter the error after the above suggest changes, please share a complete Support Bundle of Artifactory with me.

You may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:

Thank you for your patience, while I was going over the shared information.

I went through the shared logs and could observe that there are few discrepancies in the information shared.

I do however have several concerns about few aspects:

There  are two  users makelseev and adm.malekseev ,in which adm.malekseev is having read access to both local repositories test-rpm-dev-local and test-rpm-release-local.

I do see the logs for below rpm’s being deployed  to the test-rpm-dev-local repository and Hello-world-0.0.4-1.el8 deployed to the test-rpm-release-local repository successfully.

From what I see there have been many such failures where a user is trying to fetch the artifacts but because of lacking permissions they can't.Could you please share the permissions provided for user “adm.malekseev” against the repository. Please provide "Read” , Deploy/Cache" permissions to this user so that they can access the artifacts in release repository.

4) Can you please execute the REST API against the failed artifact for both hello-world-0.0.3-1.el8.noarch.rpm,Hello-world-0.0.3-1.el8.src.rpm and hello-world-0.0.4-1.el8.noarch.rpm,Hello-world-0.0.4-1.el8.src.rpm multiple times with both users(adm.malekseev & malekseev) and share us the output of that. This will provide us more detailed information, which might help in understanding the reason for failure.

5) Share with the latest support bundle after reproducing the use case along with the timeframe/name of the artifact failed to review the log from Artifactory end. You may upload the requested details to our SaaS instance as a zip using the following cURL command:

curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/186866/"

We look forward to your response.

Thank you for writing back to us. Let me explain in brief why I mentioned it as the local repository.

The docker command that the Kubernetes are hitting is - "scopelybin-docker.jfrog.io/satellites-releases/ua-analytics-forwarders-adjust-analytics-forwarder:h20"

This is a sub-domain method you are using where the syntax is "<server-name>-<repository_name>.jfrog.io/<image_path>:<tag>".

As per the above URL that you are using, you are trying to resolve the package from the repository named "docker" which is basically a local repository in Artifactory. I could see the below configuration from your instance "scopelybin" -

<localRepository>
        <key>docker</key>
        <type>docker</type>
        <includesPattern>**/*</includesPattern>
        <repoLayoutRef>simple-default</repoLayoutRef>
        <dockerApiVersion>V2</dockerApiVersion>
        <forceNugetAuthentication>false</forceNugetAuthentication>
        <ddebSupported>false</ddebSupported>
        <blackedOut>false</blackedOut>
        <handleReleases>true</handleReleases>
        <handleSnapshots>true</handleSnapshots>
        <maxUniqueSnapshots>0</maxUniqueSnapshots>
        <maxUniqueTags>50</maxUniqueTags>
        <blockPushingSchema1>false</blockPushingSchema1>
        <suppressPomConsistencyChecks>true</suppressPomConsistencyChecks>
        <propertySets>
            <propertySetRef>artifactory</propertySetRef>
        </propertySets>
        <archiveBrowsingEnabled>false</archiveBrowsingEnabled>
        <xray>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
            <dataTtl>0</dataTtl>
        </xray>
        <priorityResolution>false</priorityResolution>
        <snapshotVersionBehavior>unique</snapshotVersionBehavior>
        <localRepoChecksumPolicyType>client-checksums</localRepoChecksumPolicyType>
        <calculateYumMetadata>false</calculateYumMetadata>
        <yumRootDepth>0</yumRootDepth>
        <debianTrivialLayout>false</debianTrivialLayout>
        <enableFileListsIndexing>false</enableFileListsIndexing>
        <dockerTagRetention>1</dockerTagRetention>
        <enableComposerV1Indexing>false</enableComposerV1Indexing>
</localRepository>

As this is a local repository in the Artifactory, the docker rate limiting is not related to it. The rate-limiting is related to the Artifactory remote repository where you resolve the packages from the docker hub in the backend.

That is the reason why I have requested in my earlier email to try to resolve the packages using a docker client in a loop like for 10 times or 20 times and check if you are getting the issue or not. If you are not getting the same issue then there might be an issue on the Kubernetes side that is blocking the concurrent resolution.

I hope that the above information is helpful to you. Please let me know if you have any queries. We will be glad to assist you.

Swarnendu Kayal

Our DBA (Sebastien Ruiz in cc) moved the access_schema_version table of Artifactory under artifactoryx1 as you recommended us
However, when starting the artifactory service, it created automatically a new table in the public schema with others values than the one that was moved

With regards to your query, it is suggestible to move the access_schema_version table of Artifactory under artifactoryx1 schema and we would strongly recommend you to take the complete db backup prior to performing the change and test in the lower environment prior to updating on the production environment.

Please let us know if, in case of further queries, I will be glad to assist.

Best regards,

Thank you for your patience.

We have further tried replicating the reported issue by performing the Artifactory upgrade with the exact Artifactory version however, we see Artifactory got upgraded as expected and the application started without any issues. Please note we have tried the upgrade procedure in multiple iterations each time we see the upgrade is successful.

Hence we suspect the issue could be due to the specific to the environment and our RnD team would like to hop on a session with you hence I would request you to share with us your multiple availability time slots along with the time zone. Please note our RnD team will be working in the Israel time zone, it would be helpful if you share any overlapping timeslots.

Hi Michael,


I cannot send a feature request jira for xray as they are internal. However, the information that I would need from you to submit it would be:

  *   The use case
  *   The importance of supporting .vbf files to your company
  *   What would be the pain level or impact that your company would face without the support of .vbf files in xray

In regards to the second question, I believe that I initially misunderstood the question. However, source composition analysis on c/c++ is not available without using Conan.


Please let me know if there are any further questions.

Thank you for waiting while I was working on this case.

As a first step, I have reviewed the provided screenshot and could trace the same error in the logos attached with the Support Bundle. Attaching the same for reference:

2021-11-28T14:56:33.150Z [jfrt ] [WARN ] [2e867f0d1c0beed2] [.r.c.s.ResearchServiceImpl:229] [http-nio-8081-exec-4] - Checking remote artifactory version has failed: Received fatal alert: unknown_ca.

During the investigation, I observed that ca.pem is loaded to a different directory and I suspect this could be the reason behind the error popup on testing the remote repository.

kubectl cp /tmp/.cinitcc_351299/ca.pem artifactory-ha-app3-dev-artifactory-ha-primary-0:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/etc/access/keys/trusted/ -n lift-blue

If you would like to trust a Self-Signed certificate or upload a New CA certificate,  we need to upload the certificate to the  $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/security/keys/trusted directory as mentioned in this confluence page. Hence as a next step, I would request you to place the certificates inside the mentioned location and let us know your observations. Kindly ensure restarting the Artifactory instances after making these changes for the changes to take effect.

We look forward to your feedback.

Hi Ray,

Don't worry about the license.

Since the Xray's version filled in this ticket is V2.8.9, I thought the Artifactory V7/ Xray V3 is your testing env before, so to confirm with you if it uses trial license.
Now you confirm it is a product env with commercial license, and Xray can work with offline DB sync, then it should not be license issue.

Let's focus on Proxy issue now. And we can arrange a zoom meeting on this Friday, if the Proxy fixed then.

Thanks.

Dear Support,

For the Xray, as we provided the support bundle before.  As your findings, suspecting the license issue and not enough size of the file system.  We are suggested to increase the file system to 500G and also focus on the proxy server white list.  And the license issue is found to be not true.

As it is a production environment, it is not allowed and not possible to try and error. To ensure we can complete it and reduce the turn around time, can I propose your guys to have a urgent zoom meeting to verify the readiness of the Xray together.

Ray

Hi Vincent?

The license error only found in V3 logs.

Which type of license used for Artifactory V7 & Xray V3,  the commercial license or trial license?

If it is the commercial license, it is OK, only Artifactory license needed.

If it is the trial license, the Xray needs a separate trial license, then please confirm you got a validate Xray trial license.

Thanks.

You're correct.  Just a confirmation for the license error message.

Hi Raven,

From the latest logs, we found two errors:

1. License Error:

Hi,  Ray,

The latest uploaded support bundle of Xray only contains logs for analysis, indexer, persist, but we also need logs for server and router.
Would you please re-run the database sync and create the support bundle again?
And please check if all logs included before upload the logs, the folders should look like attached pic.

[Image_2021-11-28_11-38-11.png]


BTW, since we found Proxy issue in previous logs, would you please check and fix the proxy issue first, to validate if that could fix the sync issue?

Thanks.

Thank you for contacting JFrog support.

My name is Or Naishtat and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

Regarding your inquiry about artifact replication, could you please elaborate on the reported behavior?
- Confirm all three are local repositories, of type "generic repository"
- Please let me know if "Enable Event Replication" is enabled on the source instance, or if the replication was triggered in a different method.


- Elaborate on the steps required to reproduce this behavior.
- Reproduce this behavior, generate a Support Bundle from the source instance (Administration tab -> Support Zone (under advanced) -> Create New Support Bundle), and share it with me for inspection.
You may use the following command to upload the Support Bundle to our SaaS instance-

$ curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187412/"

*No username/password is required.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

You can go directly to version 6.23.33.

With regards to upgrade attempts, Artifactory went down due to a connection to the RDS database issue and Xray failed due to the existence of multiple endpoints in the router microservice.

I would like to get your opinion on setting up a standby session for the next planned upgrade attempt, so that JFrog Support can assist online with any issues that may arise during this process. That way we can assist online with any issues and help you get the upgrade done.

Looking forward to your response.

Thank you for the update. That's great news. If you encounter a similar error in future, you can follow the same procedure to resolve the issue. In addition to the popup screen related indexing resources appearing on the screen when you try to login to Artifactory is just to add repositories under the indexed resources, you can just skip this step if you don't want to add any repositories under indexed resources. This will not cause any issues as you can add repositories under indexed resources as explained in the following wiki page anytime.

As the reported issue is resolved. Please let us know if you have any other concerns regarding this ticket.

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to your inquiry on pgsql_tmp files, the temporary files that get created in pgsql_tmp during query execution will get deleted when the query is done, i.e all the existing running queries will be saved in the tmp folder.  Removing this can impact the current running queries.

The pgsql_tmp folder can be deleted/removed only when the query is finished or canceled, i.e Artifactory is down. However we would highly recommend you to check with your internal DataBase team (DBA) before performing any operation on the Database and also check with DBA about the “Vacuum” operation for the database.If the auto vacuum is on then the pgsql_tmp files will be deleted automatically.

The restart of the postgresql database will remove the existing pgsql_tmp files.

I hope the above information helps. Looking forward to your update.

It was a pleasure meeting you today!

Please find below the session summary.


During the meeting, we discussed the Xray integration issue. As of this morning, you did not see any UI messages or log warnings ("Xray integration is disabled"). In addition, I checked the latest logs and could see the warnings indeed don't come up.



As agreed, we will keep this case open for a while (as the issue is intermittent) and in case you continue to see the messages via Artifactory UI (under the Remote repositories page or in the Xray settings page with the admin user via Google Chrome), please generate a HAR file and share it with me within this case.



You also raised a different matter, regarding Helm charts, where the users are unable to access the Virtual repository, but since there's a separate case for it and due to the fact you did not have an example of the issue (client command and output), we agreed that we will address it in the dedicated case (186710), once you receive the screenshots from your users and share it with us through 186710.

Thank you and looking forward to your update.

Wasn't sure what's the right channel for contact regarding this, but we're
again having issues with pulling artifacts (not only helm charts this time,
but with the docker and maven repos as well).
It's intermittent, but fails more times than not, and is blocking a lot of
our company work as well as our production deployments.

This started yesterday night for us (our australia team reported it ~1am
UTC)

Can we have some help with this ASAP?

Thank you for reaching out to us.

I understand that you are looking for a way to guide your users on how to configure access to your cloud server.

In case my understanding is correct, please review this KB article, regarding Artifactory NATed IPs; as your server (vmwtec) is located within AWS Oregon, kindly ask your customers to whitelist the following IPs:

35.163.185.7 ; 52.39.154.54 ; 52.10.35.116 ; 54.70.174.156


Relying on the nslookup output is not recommended since these IPs are dynamic and change frequently.

However, the NATed IPs mentioned in the KB above do not change and if they do change, we make sure to modify it accordingly (fully maintained by us).

In case I missed anything, please elaborate, as detailed as possible, about the use-case and desired goal you'd like to achieve, I'll be happy to help.

I hope this helps and I look forward to your response.

Subject: XRay Scanning Failure on Docker Images

Hi,

Current Xray is not indexing Docker images and Layers. I have enabled the Indexing on the Repo and Watch and Polices Contains all Repositories.
I can see Java/Maven and NuGet/Powershell Artifacts scanned by Xray, but not docker.

We are close to Authorising JFrog Platform because infosec was asking us to show a demo for Thursday(02nd December 2021)  for docker image scanning, otherwise they are asking to use Qualys.

Can you help us tomorrow with a call after 11am BST to go through this and identifying the problem.

I am trying to write this because I am unable to login to the portal to raise a ticket, you can raise ticket on behalf of us.

Other issue was old Artifactory mirroring(Pulling from) new Artifactory
UseCase:  we have jetbrains Projector Registry(Docker) enabled on firewall for new Artifactory instance with Xray(Licensed), can we enable this and help us , so platform like openshift can benefit from this and Demo is based on that, we did this manually at the moment.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#187272] Smart Remote Repositories - Metadata not being replicated within expected time + disappearing

[EXTERNAL EMAIL]Hi Stephan,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

Regarding the below issues reported related to smart remote repositories, we would like to get the following details to assist further.
1) If the files got placed at the root repository on the master Artifactory instance, it takes up to hours for the metadata to be visible on the Smart Remote Repository at the edge node.
We request you to elaborate in detail about Metadata being visible on the Edge node. Do it mean, we have the List Remote Folder Items option enabled on the Edge node, however, we are not seeing the remote Artifactory items immediately? In general, if we enable this option Artifactory lets us navigate the contents of the repository at the remote Artifactory instance, for all package types, even if the artifacts have not been cached in this repository.

  *   Sometimes the new folder does appear on the Edge Node, but you are not able to expand the tree view to the files inside
  *   Sometimes the folder does appear, you can browse the file tree, and it disappear again but it does come back again minutes after working as expected
  *   Sometimes it does take a couple of minutes up to hours to appear

2) If the files got placed at the root repository on the master Artifactory instance, the metadata is visible but then suddenly disappears until it does come back after another couple of minutes.
Please confirm if the Artifactory is present in the master Artifactory, however, the Edge node doesn't show it. We would like to get the Artifactory and Edge instance support bundles which include the logs of this behavior occurrence.

  *   The files will be placed on the master repository at the Artifactory instance once and kept.
  *   I'll create and upload support bundles if we encounter the issue again. I do rely on the engineers here.

You may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:
$ curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187272/"
*No username and password are required for the upload

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Tatarao Vana

Thank you for your time today. Over the session, we verified the docker images which we have to delete before performing delete operation we have to verify what all the images have been selected for deletion through jfrog cli search. After that we ran the delete command from JFrog cli and it is in progress right now.We strongly recommend to add the labels ("Maxdays" and "MaxCount") in the docker file as mentioned in our Github page here before building a docker image and push the images to Artifactory after building them. This helps in applying the user plugin at our end which is easy and automatic for deletion(which would avoid few manual tasks). I hope you do not have any further queries and I will resolve the ticket now. If you need any assistance please reach out to us.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to your inquiry - ‘suggested ini file for mysql,’, unfortunately, these types of requests are outside the scope of what we are able to support.

If you would like to reconfigure the .ini file you could consider working with your DBA or refer to the official documentation, for eg.: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/.

As for the second query, please refer to our article, “Best Practices for Managing Your Artifactory Database” for suggested hardware.


In addition, should you encounter any related errors in Artifactory logs, please share the log folder and the DB logs with me to further investigate this behavior.

I hope this clarifies.

Let me know if you have any additional questions, I will be happy to help.

Thank you for your patience and below are the findings.
From the shared thread dumps, I see the interesting thread is with regards to the NPM remote repository where the thread is in Running state in all the thread dumps, that is from 50 seconds. From the logs, I see the requests are for (https://npm.pkg.github.com) NPM remote repository during the time of the issue. This NPM repository has proxy and user credentials configured. This might be because of the dealy in the response from the external public NPM remote repository (https://npm.pkg.github.com) or the squid proxy configured to the external public NPM remote repository that has caused the network latency and due to which the thread is open for a longer time to get the artifacts from the external public NPM remote repository​​​​​ and started thread spike.

Below is the sample NPM remote repository thread dump:

http-nio-8081-exec-62

As a next step, please check the below information:

1. Was there any network latency or an issue with the external public NPM remote repository (https://npm.pkg.github.com) due to which there was a delay in response to get the artifacts from the external public NPM remote repository.
2. With regards to the Blocked thread, I see in thread dump-1 and thread dump-2 the thread status is in Blocked but in thread dump-3, thread dump-4 thread dump-5 it is in Timed-waiting state, The thread details were about eventual storage. The thread was blocked because the thread was waiting for the temp file to create. At this moment, this might not be the root cause of the issue as the state of the thread got changed in 20 seconds.
3. I also parsed the binary store configuration and could see the default filestore cache is configured (5GB) which might be lesser for your environment. I would suggest you to increase the filestore cache to a higher value. this is just a suggestion for the increase in the performance and has nothing to do with the thread spike issue.
4. Also, from the previously shared support bundle, I couldn’t see the request logs during the time of the issue, So is it possible for you to share the Artifactory request logs of all the nodes during the time of the issue (23th November, 22:30 UTC).

Looking forward to your response.

Postgres doesn't support HTTP proxy because PostgresSQL connections are not HTTP connections AFAIK.
I think you need a SOCKS proxy to probably use that with the JDBC driver using a few system properties according to Postgres.org.
I personally do not have experience with working with SOCKS proxies.

I might also misunderstand you and the proxies you configured are not for the Postgres itself but for outgoing HTTP requests through the Router.
You might also want to configure this proxy on the application level (which is not related to the deployment) through the UI, you can also add a proxy for each repo.

Thank you for reaching out to us.

Please note that you can view not just the total size of the filestore, you can also check the size of the repositories that were replicated and compare them with the source instance (General tab --> "Artifact Count/Size" or in the Storage Summary under Admin module --> Monitoring).

One option to verify and compare the artifacts between source and target repositories is to use the below script (which I understand was shared with you by Hanan):

https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-scripts/tree/master/replicationDiff

Lastly, in a similar way to the script above, there is the option to manually use the FileList REST API to get all files checksums of a repository and diff the results between source and target repositories, for example:

curl  -uadmin:password "http://localhost:8081/artifactory/api/storage/<REPO_NAME>/?list&deep=1&listFolders=0&mdTimestamps=1"  | grep sha1

Will return a list with all the checksums of files in the repository and any discrepancy between source and target instances can be searched using the checksum search in Artifactory.



Let me know if I can further assist.

However, not all sites allow content browsing.

Hi Ray,

Don't worry about the license.

Since the Xray's version filled in this ticket is V2.8.9, I thought the Artifactory V7/ Xray V3 is your testing env before, so to confirm with you if it uses trial license.
Now you confirm it is a product env with commercial license, and Xray can work with offline DB sync, then it should not be license issue.

Let's focus on Proxy issue now. And we can arrange a zoom meeting on this Friday, if the Proxy fixed then.

Thanks.

Dear Support,


For the Xray, as we provided the support bundle before.  As your findings, suspecting the license issue and not enough size of the file system.  We are suggested to increase the file system to 500G and also focus on the proxy server white list.  And the license issue is found to be not true.


As it is a production environment, it is not allowed and not possible to try and error. To ensure we can complete it and reduce the turn around time, can I propose your guys to have a urgent zoom meeting to verify the readiness of the Xray together.


Regards,

Ray

Hi Vincent,

Since the commercial license used, that is OK.  No need for further license checking.

Let's focus on Proxy.

Thanks.

Hi Vincent?

The license error only found in V3 logs.

Which type of license used for Artifactory V7 & Xray V3,  the commercial license or trial license?

If it is the commercial license, it is OK, only Artifactory license needed.

If it is the trial license, the Xray needs a separate trial license, then please confirm you got a validate Xray trial license.

Thanks.

Hi Raven,

"if we have Artifactory license we don’t need Xray license"

You're correct.  Just a confirmation for the license error message.

Please focus on Proxy error then.

Thanks.

Hi Raven,

From the latest logs, we found two errors:

1. License Error:

2021-11-29T01:19:01.114Z [33m[jfxr ][0m [1m[31m[ERROR][0m [                ] [license:74                    ] [main                ] Unable to verify product signature

Please check if the Xray has validated license.  If there is no correct license, Xray can not do DB sync.

2. Proxy Error:

Hi,  Ray,

The latest uploaded support bundle of Xray only contains logs for analysis, indexer, persist, but we also need logs for server and router.
Would you please re-run the database sync and create the support bundle again?
And please check if all logs included before upload the logs, the folders should look like attached pic.




BTW, since we found Proxy issue in previous logs, would you please check and fix the proxy issue first, to validate if that could fix the sync issue?

Thanks.

Hope you are doing good.

Unchecking the ‘enabled’ checkbox on the replication that is currently running will stop it before it completes.



There should not be any impact on the Artifactory functionality due to running background tasks however please refer to this knowledge base article on tuning Cron Replications for Large number of Artifacts. Also, Could you please elaborate more on “Too many background tasks, but only about three tasks are running”. Maybe you can share the support bundle with me so that we are on the same page.

Either you can directly attach it via email or you can use the below curl command to upload the files to our Artifactory SaaS account.

Thank you for allowing me some time.

I have set up the environment with Artifactory v7.17.12 and v7.27.10( the current latest available) and while applying the hideUnauthorizedResources option for individual repositories it isn't taking effect however on the other hand, is working as expected when configuring for all repositories across Artifactory.

Hence I have raised a bug that will be tracked under RTFACT-26570 and is currently under the product team's review.

I will keep you posted once I hear an update from them.

On Artifactory 7.x there breaking changes, as mentioned here. As part of these changes, the Artifactory is now composed of several services (artifactory/access/router/metadata).
Adding the 'artifactory' postfix means that the request is passing directly to the artifactory service.
When upgrading from version 6.x to 7.x, we recommend generating the reverse proxy configuration from the new Artifactory version, as this configuration takes into account that when reaching Artifactory with the postfix /artifactory it will redirect the request to port 8081 which is the artifactory port. When reaching to Artifactory without the postfix, it will redirect the request to port 8082 which is the router port. The configuration also handles the Docker redirect.
For example

location ~ ^/artifactory/ {

            proxy_pass    https://<Artifactory_IP>:8081;

        }

Following that, we are also recommending generating the client configuration from the 'Set Me Up' tab so it will align with the base URL and reverse proxy configuration.

With that being said, it is possible removing the /artifactory from version 7.x by following this knowledge base article.

Hi Krzysztof,

Thank you for reaching JFrog Support.

My name is Aashish Singh and I will be assisting you with this case.

With regards to your query regarding configuration of Artifactory on Mission control as you have mentioned it is still trying to resolve old IP addresses.

You have to make sure that the Jfrog URL and Join.key should be configured properly on the mission control system.yaml file.

  *   jfrogUrl - URL to the machine where JFrog Artifactory is deployed, or the load balancer pointing to it. It is recommended to use DNS names rather than direct IPs. For example: http://jfrog.acme.com<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjfrog.acme.com%2F&data=04%7C01%7Ckrzysztof.jonaszko%40dentsplysirona.com%7Cc9032838d6784de060ba08d9b483c138%7Cbc74e59c5fa341579c376e5063d11a62%7C0%7C0%7C637739300245024309%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=ocLZkqxSyM6NYKyg1YmL83aGGiXGrscKTvjt%2BhZlAo0%3D&reserved=0> or http://10.20.30.40:8082<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2F10.20.30.40%3A8082%2F&data=04%7C01%7Ckrzysztof.jonaszko%40dentsplysirona.com%7Cc9032838d6784de060ba08d9b483c138%7Cbc74e59c5fa341579c376e5063d11a62%7C0%7C0%7C637739300245034263%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=BovZpLevm4OYTr3J1YtxWNjvMJaK0FcqLnmFpipm%2FQQ%3D&reserved=0>

It seems that the last entry that was mentioned was cut in the middle and we could not see the message you are referring to.

Please add the following debug loggers to the $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/logback.xml file(no restart is required in order to take effect):

After adding the above please try to reindex the rpm packages and share with us the Artifactory support bundle from the time of the event.

Also, Can you please confirm that are you able to upload other artifacts( with other package types beside rpm) without any issue?

Hi Cyriaque,

Thank you for reaching out.
Can you please clarify which certificates you wish to sync? If those are TLS certificates, you can place them in the trusted directory are only one of the instances in an HA cluster and they will be synced to the other instances in the cluster.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.


The error message “Query limits reached. Please narrow down your search” arises when a DB timeout has been hit, this can be resolved by increasing the timeout.

We can increase the timeout for these queries by adding a configuration to the system.yaml file in the below format, which increases the timeout from 1 minute to 2 minutes (for example), and you can then tune it a bit if the timeout persists.

server:

database:

queriesSessionProperties:

userIssuePaginationByWatchId: statement_timeout=120000

userIssueCountByWatchId: statement_timeout=120000


Once the above changes are made to the system.yaml file there is a need to restart the Xray server in order to take effect.

Thank you for contacting JFrog support.

My name is Or Naishtat and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

Regarding your inquiry about failure to create repository API, kindly elaborate on the following details for further investigation:
- How the existence of a repository check is performed.
- Let me know if running the create repository API directly from the same machine passes successfully, if not please share the verbose output with me.
- Reproduce the reported behavior, note the time/date of the reproduction, and generate a Support Bundle (administration tab -> Support Zone -> Create New Support Bundle) for further inspection.
You may use the following command to upload the Support Bundle to our SaaS instance -

$ curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187424/"

Wasn't sure what's the right channel for contact regarding this, but we're
again having issues with pulling artifacts (not only helm charts this time,
but with the docker and maven repos as well).
It's intermittent, but fails more times than not, and is blocking a lot of
our company work as well as our production deployments.

This started yesterday night for us (our australia team reported it ~1am
UTC)

Can we have some help with this ASAP?

Please be assured that I'm on top of it and discussing the scenario with internal teams, in the meantime could you please perform the below steps.

1) Create a new virtual repository and integrate only one remote repository and perform the Gradle build in the new virtual repository and share the outcome/observation with us. This will give us an idea if there are any configurational issues with the reported current virtual repository.

2) Also, share the complete support bundle from Artifactory, I'm asking for the full bundle because those will provide us the configurations details with repositories.

You may create a bundle via support bundle and you may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:
$curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/186870/"

Looking forward to your response.

From the values.yaml file you shared it seems you wish to configure external postgres DB, can you let me know why is the URL entry under the database block is commented out?
From the log you shared, it is confirmed that Xray is missing the DB connection string

Caused by: Failed to get pq connection name, host string is missing

Is the behavior persists if you remove the '#' from the URL line?
If you wish to enable external DB, please follow this section of the wiki page, although this is for Artifactory, the postgres config should work the same for Xray.
Also this wiki page for adding secrets.

2021-12-01 08:29:27.763 UTC [7] LOG S-0x5609961c4ca0: artifactory/artifactory@10.101.210.190:5432<mailto:artifactory/artifactory@10.101.210.190:5432> closing because: server_lifetime (age=5477s)

PGBOUNCER server_lifetime => The pooler will close an unused server connection that has been connected longer than this. Setting it to 0 means the connection is to be used only once, then closed. [seconds]


I -suspect- this results in a health check failure of Mission Control which seems to eventually lead to a "Terminating Artifactory".
Please note that Artifactory itself (using hikary connection pooling) does properly  detect a postgresql/pgbouncer restart and reconnects as expected,  eg :

 [c.z.h.p.PoolBase:184          ] [art-exec-16         ] - HikariCP Main - Failed to validate connection org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection@208f53f3<mailto:org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection@208f53f3> (This connection has been closed.). Possibly consider using a shorter maxLifetime value.

Is there a specific configuration that I need to apply to pgbouncer/postgresql?
Are there any JPD/MC/Artifactory/etc DB connection settings that need to be tweaked?
Thank you

Thank you for reaching out to us.

As I understand switched the Artifactory port from 8081 to 8080, however the pip.conf shows you are pointing to port 8040.
By default, port 8040 is used by the Access micro-service.

Can you change it to point to the Artifactory port? Did you make any other default port changes?

In case the issue persist with the correct configuration, please share with me the following:

1. The system.yaml file being used, which shows all the custom configurations used, including default port changes.
2. Support Bundle from Artifactory, so I can check the logs and validate whether the request has reached Artifactory.

You may upload your files using a cURL command to deploy them to our Artifactory SaaS instance:
curl -i -T {filename.ext} “https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187441/”

I look forward to your update.

Betreff: [#186728] Any task after "Artifactory Maven 3"-Task in Atlassian Bamboo build with Bamboo Artifactory plugin resulsts in error "Failing task since return code of ... was -1 while expected 0"

Hello Niklas,

Thank you for the reply and yes, I agree with your comments and investigation as you have noticed there is much difference in the content of the execution side. And all the appended information seems related to Bamboo global variables.  I was unable to conclude what was the root cause behind this at the moment as a simple commit caused this weird behaviour around the task execution. As a next step, I'm also trying to setup a similar environment in order to better understand and debug the issue further.

Meantime, could you please confirm whether any following commits also causing this behaviour or only the commit which you pointed? If possible, please try another different commit and see if it is the same behaviour.

Looking forward to your comments.

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to remote docker registry issue, we believe that its priority should be set to 'high'. The 'critical' status is used for situations where production systems are down. We will continue to address this case with the appropriate attention.

Please provide us the reverse proxy configuration & Artifactory support bundle.

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

With regards to the reported issue with the new license key, I have verified the license key in our internal portal and it looks good to me and valid until 20th Nov 2022.
Could you please share with us the below details, which will help us understand the issue and troubleshoot further.

Place the license key via terminal by navigating to $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory and place the license key in artifactory.lic File and advise if this helped to overcome the issue. This requires a restart of Artifactory. If the issue persists provide us the below details.

1) Are you encountering any error in Artifactory UI while applying the new license key. If yes, share with us the screenshot of the error.
2) Provide us the support bundle after applying the new license key, You can send me the files using the following curl command. This will deploy them to our “Supportlogs” Artifactory SaaS instance: curl -i -T filename.ext "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187484/"

I look forward to your response.


Best regards,

I finally got it to run with the following output:

Here are the number of marker layers in this repository

0


However, we are seeing this in our logs:

Could not remove category: 'docker_markers' key: 'msft-docker-remote-cache/mmlspark/build-demo/0.9.1-17-127c70a9-SNAPSHOT/manifest.json' owner: 'cpvra89a1170.wellsfargo.net' thread id: '5179' thread name: 'https-jsse-nio-8443-exec-331' lock.

Hi Cyriaque,

Thank you for reaching out.
Can you please clarify which certificates you wish to sync? If those are TLS certificates, you can place them in the trusted directory are only one of the instances in an HA cluster and they will be synced to the other instances in the cluster.
Looking forward to your response.

Here is the way to reproduce it:- given a non admin user (screenshot1)- with only permission on a very few local generic repositories (screenshot2 + screenshot3)- i am legitimately able to deploy manually a file in a local generic repository (screenshot4)- the file is deployed (screenshot5)- let's create a new release bundle, with a query to select this new file (screenshot6 + screenshot7)- then setup a path mapping to change the location of the file and change the repository name by another repository - where is don't have any permission to write (screenshot8 + screenshot9)- the release bundle is ready to be created and signed (screenshot10)- then the version of the release bundle is (screenshot11 + screenshot12) ready to distribute- we distribute it on artifactory it self named HOME (screenshot13)- distribution is successful (screenshot14)- for fun we also distribute it on our edge node (screenshot15)- to be able to see that the file has been deployed on the target repository, my user is elevated as an admin user. I'm now able to see all repositories and to see that the file is correclty distributed (screenshot16)
We expecte that the distribution process should take care of the permission of the user who is triggering the release bundle distribution.

Thank you for replying back with an update and for sharing the system.yaml and the reverse proxy configuration file with me.

The reverse proxy configuration file appears to be in order. As you may know, Apache is configured by default to use port 443 for SSL connections. This setting can be changed by editing the ports.conf file which is located under the /etc/apache2 directory usually.
Attaching an example of how to file usually looks and how it should be:
Default:

# If you just change the port or add more ports here, you will likely also
# have to change the VirtualHost statement in
# /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

Listen 80

<IfModule ssl_module> Listen 443
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_gnutls.c>
    Listen 443
</IfModule>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet


After change:

# If you just change the port or add more ports here, you will likely also
# have to change the VirtualHost statement in
# /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

Listen 80

<IfModule ssl_module> Listen 8443
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_gnutls.c>
    Listen 443
</IfModule>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet


Please make the above suggested change and let me know if the issue is resolved and you are able to access Artifactory UI over HTTPS in port 8443.

Looking forward to your update.

Good news! I believe I identified the root cause of the issue.

After taking another look at the Support Bundle you previously shared, I noticed that the Router configuration, which is located under “/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/router/”, is identical in both nodes.

This makes sense as you mentioned having an NFS which points both nodes to the data directory, which I presume is “/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/”.

When using an NFS in Artifactory HA, it should always point only to “/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/artifactory/filestore”, as the vast majority of files under previous directories must be unique per node.

To summarize, the issue occurs due to both nodes having the (same) Router configuration of “qualm-state”, causing confusion and incorrect routing and addressing.

In order to resolve the issue, please shut down both nodes, change the NFS path to “/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/artifactory/filestore” and make sure that only taskAffinity is configured in system.yaml (removing primary:).

After starting the nodes, the correct routing and configuration should be appended to each node.

I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

You may simply resize the PVC using kubectl.

a. You have to do the resize on the k8s objects directly, not through the helm client.
b. The storageclass has to have allowVolumeExpansion: true
c. Follow https://dev.to/bzon/resizing-persistent-volumes-in-kubernetes-like-magic-4f96 NOTE: Must restart the Artifactory pod(s) for resizing to happen.
d. Do NOT change chart config, or you’ll get an error on the helm upgrade command (upgrades will not change PVC size).

For example:

1. kubectl get pvc

Get the PVC name of the required pod

2. kubectl edit pvc volume-artifactory-ha-artifactory-ha-primary-0



Modify 200 (default) to be 250, for example, and Save.

3. kubectl get pods

Get the name of the pod

4. kubectl delete artifactory-ha-artifactory-ha-primary-0

Delete the pod for changes to take effect.


Please let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

We moved to the new repository, but still, encounter the problem. I also noticed that the problem is random - on requesting NuGet package I'm getting 404 Error randomly. E.g. (see screenshots below): 
curl -X GET -u "USER:PASSWORD" "https://transactcampus.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/nuget/platform-nuget/Packages(Id='Sp.Lib.Shared',Version='1.2.27'

Notes: The random 404 Error persists for all Nuget Packages in the repository.It occurs on doing requests to virtual repository platform-nuget and new local repository platform-nuget-snapshot-local as well.Re-calculating Index does not help.
The problem causes our CI builds to fail. And it goes to be critical. Let's schedule one more Web session, please.
Maxim.

When trying to install packages Artifactory returns a 404 error . The remote repository at the same time has the required package cached. What is more strange, is that some packages are downloadable, so this issue should be Artifactory specific. The problematic Artifactory uses another Artifactory as a remote repository, where the problem doesn't happen.

I am running artifactory 7.24.7 and I am upgrading to 7.27.10.
I have deployed it with Helm using artifactory-ha chart, and now with the consolidation of charts, the 7.27.10 version I am using the artifactory chart.
I disabled artifactory-ha and mision control charts, to remove all resources in k8s, and then enabled the artifactory chart with mc enabled.
Checking the logs i can see that tomcat is not starting up with the following error.

We further investigated the infrastructure side and we saw that the Route53 record is fine on AWS end and customers.jfrog.net getting resolved properly.
In addition, we also confirmed the redeployment didn't affect your instance CNAME and was not related to this issue.
Following the above, we also further looked into this issue by running nslookup:

nslookup artifacts-ui-com.customers.jfrog.net
Server:100.64.0.1
Address:100.64.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
artifacts-ui-com.customers.jfrog.netcanonical name = endpointdns-prod-2-usw2-lb.jfrog.io.
endpointdns-prod-2-usw2-lb.jfrog.iocanonical name = a71cf201c369d4cc59ba8251a3874240-1713874636.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com.

Address: 100.64.1.61

Can you please share with us the DNS resolution of artifacts.ui.com from your side, as we are getting the Non existent domain for this?

Looking forward to your reply.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

It appears that the second node (rc91b10147qv00) fails to join the cluster/existing node (rc91b10148qv00) due to its master.key being corrupted:

2021-11-30T16:01:24.400Z ^[[33m[jfxps]^[[0m ^[[34m[INFO ]^[[0m [        ] [fileutil:66          ] [main        ] no master key found, cause: encoding/hex: invalid byte: U+005B '['

This indicates that the master.key of the second node begins with the “[“ character, which is invalid.

Resolving this issue is usually a simple task which consists of:

1. Shutting down the second node (rc91b10147qv00)
2. Copying the master.key from the first node to the second (/var/opt/jfrog/xray/etc/security/master.key)
3. Making sure both master keys are completely identical by comparing their file checksums (sha1sum master.key)
4. Starting the second node

Please let me know if this resolves the issue.

Today also we faced the artifactory DB issue in between 12:20PM IST - 2:00PM IST. To resolve this issue we stopped the services in all our 6 application nodes and failover the DB to another server and restart the application.
We asked the DB team on the CPU spike and they said it is not steady climb of resources, it is a sudden spike of resources. DB team shared the list of queries that are executing during that CPU spike and also they capture the "Query Cost" for couple of queries during that spike.
As you suggested I added the AQL loggers to our logback.xml in all 6 application nodes and the aql logs are also generated and stored in aql.log file. This time I created the thread dumps in all 6 nodes using java jstack by executing the below commands as recommended.
Navigate to ‘{JAVA_HOME}/bin’*Run $ ./jstack -l <PID> > "artifactory.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).td"I also created the support bundle and uploaded to this ticket.
I uploaded a zip file called aql.zip. This zip file contains the aql logs, 5 thread dumps of each node, DB queries that shared by BD team and also the "Query Cost".
Thanks,Teja V

Hi Pirmin,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.
As the upgrade from 6.x version to 7.x version involves the introduction of additional microservices<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/System+Architecture> to the environment and a few minor changes to the reverse proxy configuration (if any), I request you to share with us the current architecture information of the environment.
For example: Load balancer, Reverse Proxy, Standalone/HA instance.

I am currently testing the upgrade path from Artifactory version 6.16 to the latest version. Meanwhile, could you please share with us the above requested information which will help us to revert with the required details accordingly?

Thank you for the response.
With Docker, you can proxy a remote Docker registry through remote repositories. A Remote Repositories defined in Artifactory serves as a caching proxy for a registry managed at a remote URL such as https://registry-1.docker.io/ (which is the Docker Hub), or even a Docker repository managed at a remote site by another instance of Artifactory.

1. Create a docker remote repository.

2. Configure the remote repository and add the above URL "https://registry-1.docker.io/" and update the username & password of your Docker hub account under the remote authentication.

3. Follow the set me up instruction and perform the docker login, then try to pull any docker image.

For complete instruction, refer to the below articles:

>> https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Docker+Registry#DockerRegistry-RemoteDockerRepositories

Thank you for joining the session with us.

Over the session, we further discussed the TIME_WAIT and ESTABLISHED count on the Artifactory port 8081, where we could notice a larger amount of TIME_WAIT on the netstat output. Ideally, to observe a high TIME_WAIT is normal and the reason is, TIME_WAIT is the state after a socket has closed, used by the kernel to keep track of packets that may have got lost and turned up late. Usually, the high number of TIME_WAIT connections is a symptom of getting lots of short-lived connections and you may can safely ignore this.

I have also attached the link to external articles for your reference describing this behaviour

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33177370/what-could-cause-so-many-time-wait-connections-to-be-open
https://serverfault.com/questions/23385/huge-amount-of-time-wait-connections-says-netstat
https://newbedev.com/huge-amount-of-time-wait-connections-says-netstat

Further, we also generated a few thread dumps over the call and verified if there are any suspicious timouts occuring at the thread dumps and we could not identify any unsafe packets by the thread id which could cause slowness or impact the Application.

Please let us know if in case of further queries, I will be glad to assist.

Thank you for meeting with me over the call today.
During the call, we were able to reproduce the issue easily on your environment. As the errors pointing to bintray-cache, we tried removing the bintray repository, but still same issue noticed during the docker pull. As a next step, we have added, below debug loggers in order to see if that can help with any additional points on the root cause of the issue:
<logger name="org.jfrog.repomd.docker">
<level value="trace"/>
</logger>
<logger name="org.artifactory.addon.docker">
<level value="trace"/>
</logger>

However, I was unable to conclude the root cause with the debug information. You do have another environment with the same version, hence, we tried pulling the same package from the other environment and noticed pull working as expected.

Hence, I agreed to investigate this offline, and please share the below information for further analysis.
1) Support bundle from Dev instance where the problem persists.
2) Also, support bundle from QA env where pull working as expected.

I will be looking forward to your reply.

Thank you for your update.
I was working on reproducing the Artifactory data source setup using Terraform and I was able to resolve a jar file from Artifactory. I have created a test .tf file that contains the following:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    artifactory = {
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/jfrog/artifactory"
      version = "2.6.17"
    }

  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
}

   repository = "maven-libs-release-local"
   path = "/a/a/1.0/a-1.0.jar"
   output_path = "tmp/artifact.jar"
}

After running the terraform apply command, I was able to see the artifact.jar file under the tmp/ directory:
This is the terraform version I have used:

I was able to reproduce the reported behavior when I stated the wrong path to the file under the repository:

Likewise there are backup files form ACCESS  in /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/backup/access/access.backup.*

Please note that there *is* a copy of the MC files in /backup/metadata/current/etc/mc/... (and for access /backup/metadata/current/etc/access*) which is where I expect them to be.
So it seems that it's either duplicating backups or not properly cleaning them.

Thank you for joining the session with us.

Over the call, we have gone through your environment where the artifacts are being built using the ANT build and deploying the artifacts to the generic repository manually. We see discrepancies found for a few jars when compared with the OWASP dependency check tool where Xray is not displaying vulnerabilities (for example: clickhouse-jdbc 0.3, CVE-2018-14668).

As a next step, we request you to share the name of artifacts that have discrepancies with the OWASP dependency check tool. Also, kindly send us the Xray report as well as the report of the dependency check tool so that it will be helpful to investigate further.

Looking forward to your response.

if I now replace the NFS share to point to artifactory/filestore I guess I need to move the files myself to the correct folders like filebeat / router / metadata /event / observability / access

and also the folders in artifactory cache / federated-queueus git import tmp usage

Correct or will they all get regenerated. Or would it be good to perform this task in a screensharing.

Subject: [#186856] Could not propagate changes to another access server:

CAUTION: This message is from an external sender
Hi Bram,

Good news! I believe I identified the root cause of the issue.

After taking another look at the Support Bundle you previously shared, I noticed that the Router configuration, which is located under "/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/router/", is identical in both nodes.

This makes sense as you mentioned having an NFS which points both nodes to the data directory, which I presume is "/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/".

When using an NFS in Artifactory HA, it should always point only to "/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/artifactory/filestore", as the vast majority of files under previous directories must be unique per node.

To summarize, the issue occurs due to both nodes having the (same) Router configuration of "qualm-state", causing confusion and incorrect routing and addressing.

In order to resolve the issue, please shut down both nodes, change the NFS path to "/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/artifactory/filestore" and make sure that only taskAffinity is configured in system.yaml (removing primary:).

After starting the nodes, the correct routing and configuration should be appended to each node.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Thank you for contacting JFrog support.

My name is Or Naishtat and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

Regarding your inquiry about viewing all the watches on JFrog platform, you may use the UI to view all the watches (administration tab -> Xray -> Watches & Policies -> Watches)
Please note that the use must have a "manage watches" permission to view this information.


Alternatively, you may use the "Get Watches" REST API with a privileged user to get a list of all watches in the system.

I hope this information helps.

Best regards,
Or Naishtat

With regards to the question about the server_name, Server names are defined using the server_name directive and determine which server block is used for a given request. They may be defined using exact names, wildcard names, or regular expressions:

server {
listen       80;
server_name  example.org  www.example.org;
...
}

server {
listen       80;
server_name  *.example.org;
...
}

server {
listen       80;
server_name  mail.*;
...
}

server {
listen       80;
server_name  ~^(?<user>.+)\.example\.net$;
...
}

So if you are accessing the Artifactory with Artifactory.com domain and would like to route the request to Artifactory.com domain then the server_name in the nginx configuration should be Artifactory.com or *.Artifactory.com

server {
listen port;
server_name  Artifactory.com *.Artifactory.com;
...
}​​​​​​​

Also, Can you please share with us the Nginx and Artifactory logs after reproducing the issue?
You may upload the requested files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:
curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/186866/"

*No username and password are required.

We are looking forward to your reply.

You can telnet to localhost and port number together, we also have an IO exception which shows a problem with service itself however network issue would be the first one.

Subject: [#187116] Error when setting up remote docker repository pointing to https://releases-docker.jfrog.io

Hi Maria,

Thank you for meeting with me over the call today.
During the call, we were able to reproduce the issue easily on your environment. As the errors pointing to bintray-cache, we tried removing the bintray repository, but still same issue noticed during the docker pull. As a next step, we have added, below debug loggers in order to see if that can help with any additional points on the root cause of the issue:
  <logger name="org.jfrog.repomd.docker">
    <level value="trace"/>
  </logger>
  <logger name="org.artifactory.addon.docker">
    <level value="trace"/>
  </logger>

However, I was unable to conclude the root cause with the debug information. You do have another environment with the same version, hence, we tried pulling the same package from the other environment and noticed pull working as expected.

Hence, I agreed to investigate this offline, and please share the below information for further analysis.
   1) Support bundle from Dev instance where the problem persists.
   2) Also, support bundle from QA env where pull working as expected.

I will be looking forward to your reply.

Thank you for sharing the log files from the load balancer. I have parsed through the logs focusing more on API calls being executed in regards to the "listeners" attributes. However, most of the log traces especially the POST calls which would be responsible for any functionality invocation are not indicating any suspicious action towards the load balancer entity.

The only references we could observe from the logs are related to deployment tasks being done through the Load Balancer towards the Artifactory instance.

Upon referring to a few other external sources, I could correlate one of the public issues reported under AWS - Open issues with this case where the environment seems different (using Docker swarm), however, the reported scenario correlates with the issue reported in this support case.

If automation is involved in the provisioning of the load balancer configuration and the Artifactory instances, would it be possible for you to share with us the architecture diagram that illustrates the complete setup including the AWS template (if any) being used to provision the instances? This information will help us to understand the request flow on a hierarchical basis and based on that we would be able to conclude the possible root cause of this issue.

We have few questions to clear out


  1.  For the storage, how we expect artifact storage volume and make 3 times of it. How it works? We didn't get this one








[cid:image001.png@01D7E6B5.D2342220]



  1.  How do we find the embedded tomcat version in artifactory?
  2.  Configuring the s3 for file storage object other than binary.xml file do we have any config files to modify? I see binary.xml only.


Thanks,
Vamsi

Betreff: [#187414] Helm Concourse

Hi Philipp,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

My name is Andrey and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

With regards to your inquiry, it is possible to use the mentioned repository by creating a Helm remote repository with the following URL: https://concourse-charts.storage.googleapis.com/<https://concourse-charts.storage.googleapis.com/index.yaml>

To rewrite external dependencies<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Kubernetes+Helm+Chart+Repositories#KubernetesHelmChartRepositories-AutomaticallyRewritingExternalDependencies>, it is required to enable the “Enable Dependency Rewrite” checkbox in the Advanced section in the remote repository.

As a side note, additional information about how to use Artifactory with an Air Gap can be found in the following article<https://jfrog.com/blog/using-artifactory-with-an-air-gap/>.

Please let me know if you were able to configure the remote repository, however, if you encounter any issue during the configuration, please share with me the full steps that were performed and the observed errors.

Looking forward to your update.

Best regards,
Andrey Granovsky

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

Activating the Xray Trial License is done as described in the Onboarding Wizard page.
After installing Xray and starting the service, you should refresh the JFrog Platform UI and the Onboarding Wizard should pop. During Onboarding, you should apply the Xray Trial License.

If the above suggestion is not working for you, kindly share the following information with me:

Which Xray version are you using?
How did you apply the Xray Trial License? Please share the steps taken.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Daniel Poterman

right away I have uploaded the current "xray-server-service.log" via the upload link. Please check!

From our server is the https://jxray.jfrog.io fully accessible (proxy does not block to that domain) but maybe the proxy configuration of the application is not set correctly. (more details s. the uploaded log-file)

An excerpt of the log says following:

In our Artifactory instance we created a Remote Repository for a Docker Registry hosted on Cloudsmith. 
I can pull images directly from the Cloudsmith registry, however, when I try to use my Remote Repository it fails. It can successfully download a few layers, but it can't get one of the layers, and the pull operation fails with the following message:» docker pull <image name>
...
error pulling image configuration: unknown blob
Investigating the server logs of Artifactory reveals the following warning:2021-11-11 11:11:11,111 [http-nio-8081-exec-1111] [WARN ] (o.a.r.RemoteRepoBase:472) - my-cloudsmith-remote: Error in getting information for '<...image/tag ...>/sha256__<...

In the UI of Artifactory it can be observed that most layers of the image can be pulled, but usually a single one fails, indicated by a blob which name ends with .marker. (See attachment.)
This issue happens with all Cloudsmith registries I tried, and all images I try to pull bump into this problem, although I can pull these images directly from Cloudsmith. In our Artifactory instance, other Remote repositories for Docker work fine however.
I tried the following to resolve the issue, but all my attempts failed:Zap cacheRecreate the Remote RepositoryChange the default settings of the Docker Remote repository, e.g.:Disable "Block pulling of image manifest v2 schema 1"Enable "Enable Foreign Layers Caching" with an inclusive patternDisable "Store Artifacts Locally" (turns out, this is not even allowed for Docker based repos)Enable "Bypass HEAD Requests"Enable "Allow Content Browsing"Could you please advise what might be wrong or what should I check in this setup? Are there any specific limitations regarding Cloudsmith?
Thanks in advance,Dávid CsákváriAdnovum

Thanks for your questions. Following are the answers for your questions:

1. Did you start seeing this behavior all of sudden or is there any recent configuration change or upgrade activity performed in the current environment?
    Yes, all of sudden the issue shows up without any configuration change or upgrade activities

2. Provide the details about what are the repositories configured in virtual and details of artifacts you have in both remote and local repositories.
    We have a local repository scg-mvn-release-local in the artifactory server, which is included in a virtual repository libs-release. We have a pipeline pushed the artifacts into scg-mvn-release-local and we have another
    pipeline to download the uploaded artifact from the virtual repository libs-release, the issue is after downloading  the maven-metadata.xml file from virtual repository libs-release, the content of
   the maven-metadata.xml file has been changed:

  As the screenshot above on the right side shown the content of maven-metadata.xml file downloaded from the virtual repository has been changed in <versioning></versioning> section , which removed the SNAPSHOT and timestamp in the versioning, that keeps the pipeline failing to download the SNAPSHOT artifacts.

3. Does this behavior is occurring for a specific package or all the packages.
   This only happens with downloading the SNAPSHOT artifacts with specific path .

4. Please describe more details about the statement "virtual repo is not able to download the correct version of local repo". Does it mean, while downloading an artifact, the correct version is not being downloaded from the local repository?
   Please refer the answers above. The pipeline can only download artifact from virtual repo. The maven-metadata.xml downloaded from the local repository will keep the content intact

5. What is the expected behavior and what is happening currently while resolving artifacts from the virtual repository.
  The expected behavior is the content of maven-metadata.xml file downloaded from the virtual repository not be changed by removing the SNAPSHOT and timestamp in the versioning section, as it's downloaded from the scg-mvn-release-local repository

Betreff: [EXT] [#187372] Virtual repo not able to download correct versions

This message is from an EXTERNAL SENDER - be CAUTIOUS, particularly with links and attachments

Hi Ajit,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

Regarding the issue reported while resolving artifacts from virtual repositories, we would like to get the following details before scheduling a web session to discuss further.
1. Did you start seeing this behavior all of sudden or is there any recent configuration change or upgrade activity performed in the current environment?
2. Provide the details about what are the repositories configured in virtual and details of artifacts you have in both remote and local repositories.
3. Does this behavior is occurring for a specific package or all the packages.
4. Please describe more details about the statement "virtual repo is not able to download the correct version of local repo". Does it mean, while downloading an artifact, the correct version is not being downloaded from the local repository?
5. What is the expected behavior and what is happening currently while resolving artifacts from the virtual repository.
6. Reproduce the issue again and collect the client output and Artifactory support bundle for further debugging.

You may upload files using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:

Hello,
As we discussed I'm sending an account of my experience using the
artifactory plugin and the cause that made me move stop using and
continuing the poc without

As a first test of using the plugin I tried to simply create a docker image
and push it to an artifactory repo.
The first stage of initialising a server instance in the pipeline to my
knowledge succeeded however i met problems from the docker push method I
tried several times to push the image however it could not resolve the
artifactory as first due to ssl and or not being able to find the hostname,
I will revist the documentation and give it another go, after completing
the POC.

Thank you for your answer. 
The problem is that we have have thousands of CI/CD build plans and hundreds of deployments. We have a few thousand of Artifactory users too.So, that is why we cannot just change the consumption URL - it is going to be painful to make so many changes without disrupting our CI/CD & development processes. 
We do not need any other service (besides artifactory) such as access, router or metadata, so we can explicitly specify /access/, or /mc, or /pipelines when we need to connect to them specifically. 
We will try to follow the KB: https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/how-to-remove-artifactory-from-the-context-url-in-artifactory-7/
Thanks.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
My name is Andrey and I will be assisting you with this ticket.
In order to better understand the reported behavior, please share with me the full steps that were performed to export and import the mentioned repository.
Additionally, please share with me a screenshot of the exported repository content, does it contain the lower and upper case paths?
Were exports performed on Artifactory 7.25.6 version with MySQL database and imported to the same version of Artifactory with Postgres database?
Is the behavior observed on all of the repository types or only on a specific type (Maven/Npm/Docker etc..)?
Looking forward to your update.

We observed something while trying to replicate this issue which we would like to bring to your notice.



In the below screenshot for the ‘Composer mirror’ details you have provided the API call path. Can we once try replacing the same with the original path to see if it works ?

As we feel this might be a blocker here.


Please let me know if you have any further questions regarding the same.

Thank you for reaching out.

I have looked over the repository and proxy configurations and noticed one thing that may be causing the issue. I see that following line in the NGINX configuration:

Please update this to the following and let me know if this solves the issue:

If  the error persists, please send me the zipped Artifactory logs folder ($JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/log) as these weren’t included in the Support Bundle.

Does the image still exist in the remote repository? If so, did you try to scan the image directly from the remote repo as well?

Also, please share with us the support bundles<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Support+Zone#SupportZone-Creatingasupportbundle> from Artifactory and Xray from the time of the event in order for us to investigate the case further.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.
My name is Andrey and I will be assisting you with this ticket.
With regards to your behavior, as I understood the image pulling succeeded once you saved the configuration and pulled images with the same "aptiv-gm" user from the ghcr.io remote repository.
Please clarify regarding the Harbor fails to sync, and share with me the mentioned errors that you encountered along with the related repositories names.
Additionally, reproduce the behavior and share with me the related client output and Artifactory Support Bundle from the time of the issue, as I want to review the Artifactory logs.
You may upload the generated bundle using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:
curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187437/"
Looking forward to your update.

Thank you for reaching out.

Currently, this isn’t supported via the API. The closest call would be Update Repository  but this call succeeds even if the ‘Test’ button fails.

This being said, the best way to best this is some sort of ping command from the Artifactory machine to the RedHat server. If this connection works, then the remote repository will also work.

Additionally, this is a great idea for a feature request. If you’re so inclined, please create a new request here .

I hope this helps.

After investigating this with the RnD team, we suspect that the behavior is caused by the federation process is timing out.
We suggest increasing the timeout of the federation on the source with the following steps

1. Edit the file access.config.latest.yml on the source with the following

federation:
...
  outbound:                    # outbound configuration specifies parameters for sending data
   ...
 timeout-millis: 3600000


2. Save the file under the name access.config.import.yml

3. Restart Artifactory.

You can refer to this wiki page for the full template and the updating steps.

Please let me know if the behavior persists after implementing the above.

Best regards,
Adi Malca

You can sign a Release Bundle, Signing a Release Bundle finalizes the process of creating a Release Bundle. This sets the Release Bundle status to Signed and the Release Bundle can no longer be edited.

Also, JFrog Distribution secures Release Bundle delivery using a GPG keys pair (private and public). The created Release Bundle that's distributed to an Artifactory Edge Node is signed with a private GPG key. The Artifactory Edge Node verifies the Release Bundle signature with a public GPG key.

We would have to take a look at logs to confirm if there are also PKI errors. This wiki<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Using+TLS+Certificates+as+a+Client#UsingTLSCertificatesasaClient-TrustingaSelf-SignedCertificateoraNewCA> has details on trusting self-signed certificates.

Setting up Circle of Trust is not a prerequisite for this type of setup - but can be for more advanced scenarios.

Please try using the join key from the GUI and updating the trust store with the self-signed certificates if needed. If the pairing still fails, please retrieve Support Bundles<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Support+Zone#SupportZone-Creatingasupportbundle> from both JPD deployments and attach them to the case. The bundles can be attached to the case via the Support portal or using the curl command below:

*

*       curl -i -T file.zip "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187404/"
If the logs don't have enough information to troubleshoot the issue, we can provide instructions for raising the logging level to DEBUG or TRACE.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please let us know.

We don't have any records configured for artifacts.ui.com. The DNS zone is ui.com, not artifacts.ui.com, therefore we have CNAME records configured for multi-level subdomains such as apt-internal.artifacts.ui.com, etc. Additionally, there were no issues with CNAME records since we created them months ago during the initial migration from Bintray up to recently, thus I think the issue might be on your side, not with our DNS records.

two things:

Problem 1:

In the JSON output it looks a bit different than in the plain text format but what might be the problem is that "impact_paths" of the "Commons Collections" vulnerabilities also contains "Spring Core" which I do not understand. As far as I see it "Spring Core" is not using "Commons Collections". This might be the reason that in the plain text output the "Common Collections" vulnerabilities are also shown for "Spring Core".

Problem 2 (most important):

If you uncomment the dependency to "spring-boot-starter-web" and comment the dependency to "spring-core" in the example pom.xml, then the Spring Core vulnerability is not shown anymore. This vulnerability should be shown in my opinion as "Spring Core" is a transitive dependency of "Spring Boot Starter Web".

Hello Michael,

Thank you for reaching out to us and sharing the example project with us, it is very helpful.

I tried to reproduce the same behavior as you see in your environment and this is the output I got from the am command (used "--format json")

Thank you for your response.

Going over the Support bundle you shared with me, I believe the root cause for the reported behavior is due to the size of the config descriptor which has 156862 lines and weighs about 8 MB and the concurrent requests to modify this file:

2021-11-23T11:34:35.081Z [jfrt ] [INFO ] [22b18c55b2e215d1] [c.CentralConfigServiceImpl:895] [http-nio-8081-exec-8] - Reloading configuration... old revision 358780, new revision 358781

2021-11-23T11:34:41.581Z [jfrt ] [INFO ] [e1947902f3c9e8ce] [c.CentralConfigServiceImpl:895] [http-nio-8081-exec-1] - Reloading configuration... old revision 358783, new revision 358784
2021-11-23T11:34:42.924Z [jfrt ] [INFO ] [d141254644e3ed95] [c.CentralConfigServiceImpl:895] [http-nio-8081-exec-5] - Reloading configuration... old revision 358784, new revision 358785


As you can see from the above log snippet, the config descriptor was changed 5 times in less than 10 seconds which leads to the below error:

2021-11-23T11:34:44.046Z [jfrt ] [ERROR] [542c27fbd0feff22] [o.j.c.ExecutionUtils:178      ] [http-nio-8081-exec-6] - Last retry failed: Failed to reload configuration: null. Not trying again
2021-11-23T11:34:44.050Z [jfrt ] [ERROR] [542c27fbd0feff22] [c.e.m.GlobalExceptionMapper:48] [http-nio-8081-exec-6] - Could not merge and save new descriptor [org.jfrog.common.ExecutionFailed: Last retry failed: Failed to reload configuration: null. Not trying again]
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not merge and save new descriptor [org.jfrog.common.ExecutionFailed: Last retry failed: Failed to reload configuration: null. Not trying again]


Each change in this file will also update the db entry for this file and use the revision number, which may take longer than usual due to the size of the file and when adding multiple requests to change this file lead to the failure we see in the logs.

I recommend allowing few more seconds for the changes to apply properly and then proceeding with the delete requests.

I hope you find this information useful.

Thank you for writing back to us.

We understand your concern around the data privacy. We will be happy to hop on a session, if you encounter any  issue during migration to troubleshoot.

Thank you for trying the suggested changes.
Restarting the Xray should be fine in this case. Could you please zip the below folders and share them with us to review the latest logs.

>> $XRAY_HOME/var/etc folder.

W.r.t. reconfiguring our Artifactory v2.6.6 instance to run from a private IP, I renamed $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/artifactory.config.latest.xml to $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/artifactory.config.import.xml and restarted Artifactory.
I note that the changes took effect like you'd mentioned and that the Artifactory "Server Name" and "Custom URL Base" parameters were modified as expected. However, while I see multiple artifactory.config.bootstrap.xml files at $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc I do not see any artifactory.config.bootstrap.xml at $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc.
(eris):root:/artifacts/artifactory-powerpack-2.6.6/etc>ll *bootstrap*.xml-rwxr-xr-x 1 artifactory artifactory 19448 Apr 15 2013 artifactory.config.bootstrap.1.xml-rwxr-xr-x 1 artifactory artifactory 90824 Nov 18 08:37 artifactory.config.bootstrap.2.xml-rwxr-xr-x 1 root    root    90824 Dec 1 02:04 artifactory.config.bootstrap.xml

Is this ok?
By the way, I was successfully able to configure Apache Tomcat used by the Artifactory v.2.6.6 instance to run from a 10.0.0.2 private IP address and 8000 port combination today with nginx configured as a reverse proxy (for the Artifactory application) on the public IP address. Many thanks for your help in providing the sample nginx configuration file and for providing the procedure to update the Artifactory XML configuration file.

we had from our users the request to provide a webhook to Github actions when a new artifact is uploaded to the user's repository. 
For the Github Integration, the only way I found to trigger actions from an external source is to use the Repository Dispatch (as described in https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/github-actions-trigger-via-webhooks/).
The Github API requires a request in the following format:Headers:
"Authorization": "token "
Body:
{
"event-type":""
"client-payload": {}
}

In Jfrog Artifactory I tried to configure a Webhook under Administration -> General -> Webhook.
The issue with this webhook is that the webhook sent by Jfrog has the following Body:{
 "domain": "artifact",
 "event-type": "deployed",
 "data": {
 "name": "sample.txt",
 "path": "sample_dir/sample.txt",
 "repo_key": "sample_repo",
 "sha256": "sample_checksum",
 "size": 0,
 "source_repo_path": "sample_repo",
 "target_repo_path": "sample_target_repo"
 },
 "jpd_origin": "https://jfrog.dev.hub.vwgroup.com"
}
Since Github isn't accepting any additional keys, the webhook fails.
Is there any option how to customize the webhook body. 
I'm also aware that there is a webhook plugin that I already tested to customize for Github.The Issue with the plugin would be that all webhook configurations are part of the webhook.config.json. Since Github requires a User token and we expect that many projects would be entered in those webhooks, the json file doesn't seem to be the best way to manage all webhooks and user secrets.
Regards,Oliver

I have performed a similar setup at my end and I see all the environment variables are not mapped in the system.yaml file, for your reference please find below steps followed:
-> Installed Docker-Compose and Docker client on a virtual machine.
-> Created a Docker-Compose yaml file, and installed Artifactory v6.x, please find below configuration:


-> After which I have followed the Artifactory upgrade procedure mentioned in our upgrade wiki page and I see some old environment variables have not been migrated to the system.yaml file.


I have further discussed this behavior with our internal teams, and it is an issue at our end I will be creating a JIRA and will keep you posted in this regard.

And regarding the mapping of existing environment variables into the new Artifactory instance v7.x, we can configure the same in the system.yaml file, please find below for the same:

As per your recommendation, I tried direct upgrade from 6.16.0 to latest version 7.27.10 on our test instance. The migration script completed successfully, however, the artifactory instance would not come up and would fail with below error.

artifactory    | 2021-12-01T10:35:07.888Z [jfevt] [WARN ] [35f4679d3149dfbf] [domain_client.go:57           ] [main                ] - Error occurred when refreshing domain cache all domain endpoint failed : Fetch domains from http://localhost:8046/artifactory/api/events/domains failed (returned 404), Fetch domains from http://localhost:8046/distribution/api/v1/events/domains failed (returned 404),  [domain_client]

If I upgrade the artifactory to 7.7.3 version then this issue is not seen.

Also, once the artifactory is upgraded to 7.7.3, I am able to change the container version to latest 7.27.10 and boot the artifactory to latest version.

Any idea about this error on latest artifactory version?

Thanks,

Thank you for the meeting.
During the session, we saw error 500 during the export but couldn't find the relevant error due to the verbosity of the logs.
In addition, you showed me errors related to build info repos that fails to import and I believe it might be due to their names which contain special characters.

We agreed to take it offline so I can investigate the error 500 which we have seen during the export and try to reproduce the build info import issue.
As agreed, please share with me the following:
1. A Support Bundle from today + specify the time of the export.
2. Several build info Json files in order to reproduce the issue, so I can attempt to reproduce it on my end as well.

You may upload the files using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:

curl -i -T filename.txt "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/186069/"

Also, we would like to have a Zoom session tomorrow to sync up on the issue and validate the results at your end. Please let me know multiple availabilities for tomorrow(I hope you are working in IL timezone)? According to our mutual availability we will have screen sharing session.

Hello Prabhakar,

Please be assured that I'm on top of it and discussing the scenario with internal teams, in the meantime could you please perform the below steps.

1) Create a new virtual repository and integrate only one remote repository and perform the Gradle build in the new virtual repository and share the outcome/observation with us. This will give us an idea if there are any configurational issues with the reported current virtual repository.

2) Also, share the complete support bundle from Artifactory, I'm asking for the full bundle because those will provide us the configurations details with repositories.

You may create a bundle via support bundle<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fconfluence%2Fdisplay%2FRTF%2FGetting%2BSupport%23GettingSupport-Creatingasupportbundle&data=04%7C01%7Cprabhakar.t%40honeywell.com%7C54276e5a9ea74e4ae26908d9b4b4894d%7C96ece5269c7d48b08daf8b93c90a5d18%7C0%7C0%7C637739509766998477%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=B03HZRa0GcMONquCzGWM6KH6ycPnYZvBPzesJMbWFaE%3D&reserved=0> and you may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:

Thanks, that was helpful.

Next I'm trying to : https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Working+with+Federated+Repositories
I have done all the Prerequisites - but I have not been able to verify that the Circle of Trust is good - how can I verify that? (the root.crt got picked up and 'disappeared' as mentioned in the documentation)

The problem I'm having is that I can't add the member to the federated repo. It comes back with a "read timed out".

Subject: [#187404] Unable to pair/register platform deployment

Hello Jan,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

The join key can be retrieved from the UI and used as the pairing token. The join.key file only contains the encrypted value which is not usable for joining or pairing. Navigate to Administration tab > Security > Settings > Connection Details, then enter your admin password and click "Unlock" to retrieve the join key.

We would have to take a look at logs to confirm if there are also PKI errors. This wiki<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Using+TLS+Certificates+as+a+Client#UsingTLSCertificatesasaClient-TrustingaSelf-SignedCertificateoraNewCA> has details on trusting self-signed certificates.

Setting up Circle of Trust is not a prerequisite for this type of setup - but can be for more advanced scenarios.

Please try using the join key from the GUI and updating the trust store with the self-signed certificates if needed. If the pairing still fails, please retrieve Support Bundles<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Support+Zone#SupportZone-Creatingasupportbundle> from both JPD deployments and attach them to the case. The bundles can be attached to the case via the Support portal or using the curl command below:

*

*       curl -i -T file.zip "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187404/"
If the logs don't have enough information to troubleshoot the issue, we can provide instructions for raising the logging level to DEBUG or TRACE.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please let us know.

All the actions are related to the recent activities that I have made. It's strange why the user is admin and IP is 52.215.237.185. Our cluster isn't accessible from public IPs as it deployed to our virtual private cloud and accessible only from private subnets.
Also, we have found this IP address in the issue[1] and README.md[2] file in the JFrog official repository.

Thank you for joining the session today.

In the session, you reported that the issue does no longer exists. A possible explanation for this behavior is that the anonymous user didn't have sufficient permissions for this repo.

Another topic that we discussed is ticket 163475, I have forwarded your request about a patch/release with this fix implemented and we will push it with higher priority to the product team.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.


I have reviewed the attached bundle and could see that you are using the S3 Cluster Binary Provider template and the default cache configurations.

That means that the cache is configured to 5GB.

I would also like to clarify that we have an open issue regarding the cache size in the UI - RTFACT-26417, “maxCacheSize in storage summary page isn't shown under the Cache-FS”.

Basically, the storage size we see under the cache is the machine total size and not the cache.

This affects Artifactory version 7.27.3 and above. Though the ticket details notes you are using version 7.25.3, in the support bundle I see that the actual installed version is 7.27.3.

Following the above, we need to understand what exactly is occupying most of the storage.

Please run the below commands and share the complete output with me:

$du -hs $JFrog_Home/artifactory/var/data/artifactory/* | sort -h
$du -hs $JFrog_Home/artifactory/var/data/artifactory/cache/* | sort -h
$du -hs $JFrog_Home/artifactory/var/data/artifactory/eventual/* | sort -h



Looking forward to your response,

I thought that xray only needs to access JIRA.
Does JIRA servers needs to access xray ?

I seem to pick the prod env instead of dev env.
I will reconfigure and test it again.
I will keep you updated.

Hi Shay,

Going over the logs you shared with me, I found the following error:
2021-11-30T05:40:00.675Z [33m[jfxr ][0m [1m[31m[ERROR][0m [59359cd373765dc3] [ticketing_service:563         ] [main                ] Unable to get jira projects, details: Get "https://issues.devops.poalim.bank/rest/api/2/project": dial tcp 172.18.135.240:443: i/o timeout
It appears that Artifactory fails to reach the JIRA server which causes the connection timeout. Please test pinging JIRA from the Xray server and vice versa to make sure the connection is valid and then try the Basic Authentication once more, just to verify the connection is good.

Looking forward to your response.

I’m not completely sure what IBM means by ‘Allows path separators in the image name’. If they mean that there can be a ‘/’ in the image name, as mentioned here , then Artifactory does support this.

I hope this helps.

Hi Bram,

You can delete all the other microservice directories under the data directory (excluding Artifactory). I can confirm that they are automatically generated upon restart.

As for the Artifactory directory, you can delete everything there excluding the "filestore" directory, these will be regenerated as well.

If you want to take extra safety precautions, you can backup the entire data directory.

I suggest you begin the process by yourself and if any issues occur, we can hop on a session and continue troubleshooting.

Thank you for your patience while we are working on this matter.

I can confirm the general compatibility of the target instance.

The only thing I want to point out is that as of now, Artifactory 7.x supports PostgreSQL versions up until 13.x.

There is no official support for version 14.x yet.


I hope this clarifies.

Let me know if you have any additional questions, I will be happy to help.

With regards to RSA keys you may refer to this wiki page about RSA Key Pairs.
Furthermore, kindly note that as the main topic with regards to GPG keys has been concluded we will go ahead and close this ticket.

In case the inquiry was misunderstood regrading RSA Keys or further assistance is required, please create a new Support ticket regrading it, it will help avoiding a discussion between different topics in the same thread and confusion. We'll of course be happy to assist.

CAUTION: This message is from an external sender
Hi Bram,

You can delete all the other microservice directories under the data directory (excluding Artifactory). I can confirm that they are automatically generated upon restart.

As for the Artifactory directory, you can delete everything there excluding the "filestore" directory, these will be regenerated as well.

If you want to take extra safety precautions, you can backup the entire data directory.

I suggest you begin the process by yourself and if any issues occur, we can hop on a session and continue troubleshooting.

Thank you for your patience while I was working on this case.

As a first step, I have gone through the “ci-maven-release-local” repository settings and understood that in the Source instance the checksum policy is “Verify against client checksums”  and in the target instance, the checksum policy is “Trust server generated checksums”.

From the source instance logs,  I do not see any relevant entries for the ‘CheckoutOfferService-2022.1.4.tgz' package.

From the target instance logs,  I see the below log entries that state the replication process of
‘CheckoutOfferService-2022.1.4.tgz’ artifact from the target instance. However, I do not notice any errors or exceptions related to the replication process.

I further discussed this warning “Client did not publish a checksum value. If you trust the uploaded artifact you can accept the actual checksum by clicking the 'Fix Checksum' button” with our internal teams and would like to elaborate on the outcome of it.

In the source instance, I see the checksum policy is Verify against client checksums. When working with this policy, if a client deploys a file without the checksum value, then the corresponding warning message will be displayed over the artifact.  In other words, if a user deploys a file with checksum as the header during the deployment, Artifactory will calculate the file's checksum and then compare the client uploaded checksum and the Artifactory calculated checksum.

You may refer to this REST API on how to deploy artifacts by checksum. I would like to demonstrate this REST API with an example. I have deployed a sample text file using the mentioned REST API and I’m attaching the screenshot for reference:





Target instance :



In case if I’m performing the same deployment with the checksum headers, I’ll be having the same warning as mentioned :


Generally, this warning message should not cause any impact while downloading the artifact. In case if you are observing any issues while downloading it, please do let us know the steps you are following to download the file? Is it through any external tools or curl or wget etc., Please share the relevant commands for our reference so that we can try the same from our end.

I hope the above provided information was helpful to understand the cause behind this warning message. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions, I will be happy to answer them.

Looking forward to your response.

This reply follows the meeting we had yesterday, which was attended by Daniel and Ed from Bloomberg.
The main purpose of that meeting was the PyPI issue from ticket 185745, however, we have also touched point on the current issue reported here.

This is to confirm we were able to reproduce a problematic behavior, where updating a group with thousands of users is taking a significant amount of time, and can also impact the system performance/stability.
We have forwarded this issue internally and will keep you posted once we have an update (we should have one next week).

I wanted to share with you some more details on how this works "under the hood", so you can also understand the source of the impact you had.
I've discovered that once you trigger(save) the group with updated attributes, as part of the current implementation, Artifactory will send requests to Access in the amount of 8x the number of users. So, having 3500 users in a group results in 28K requests from Artifactory to Access as part of this group update.
The way Artifactory communicates with Access is via an internal thread pool that is by default limited to 50 threads. Which means, there are 50 threads that should handle the 28K requests.
As handling 28K requests takes a bit of time, anything that requires Artifactory to reach Access is getting queued after these 28K requests. Such as Access Token verifications, permissions, etc.
This is why indeed this issue affects other operations.

I would like to ask the following information:
1. $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/tomcat/conf/server.xml - to check the configured maxThreads for both Artifactory and Access.
2. $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/artifactory.system.properties - to check the value of "artifactory.access.client.max.connections".
3. Do you have JMX monitoring for Artifactory? If yes, do you monitor the BUSY Tomcat threads for ports 8081 & 8040? In case you do, can you share the graph of the 8040 BUSY threads over time, including the time of reproducing this issue?

Approaches we can take in order to immidietly remedy the situation
1. Adding users to groups via "Update User" API, where such issue is not present.
2. Consider whether the "readers" group is needed. The "readers" group is a default group created as part of the Artifactory installation. The question is whether this group is really needed, and whether it is included in some of your permission targets. If you do need a concept of "readers", perhaps you can split the one large group into smaller sub-groups per your internal organizational structure. Basically, to avoid having a group with more than 1K users.

As mentioned above, we have forwarded this bug internally and should have some feedback to share with you by next week.

Waiting forward hearing back from you. Let me know if there is anything additional I can assist with in this regard.

Best regards,
Ariel Kabov

Hi Cyriaque,


Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.


I have reviewed the attached bundle and could see that you are using the S3 Cluster Binary Provider<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+the+Filestore#ConfiguringtheFilestore-S3ClusterBinaryProvider> template and the default cache configurations.

That means that the cache is configured to 5GB.


I would also like to clarify that we have an open issue regarding the cache size in the UI - RTFACT-26417<https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-26417>, "maxCacheSize in storage summary page isn't shown under the Cache-FS".

Basically, the storage size we see under the cache is the machine total size and not the cache.

This affects Artifactory version 7.27.3 and above. Though the ticket details notes you are using version 7.25.3, in the support bundle I see that the actual installed version is 7.27.3.


Following the above, we need to understand what exactly is occupying most of the storage.


Please run the below commands and share the complete output with me:




$du -hs $JFrog_Home/artifactory/var/data/artifactory/* | sort -h

$du -hs $JFrog_Home/artifactory/var/data/artifactory/cache/* | sort -h

$du -hs $JFrog_Home/artifactory/var/data/artifactory/eventual/* | sort -h




Looking forward to your response,

I don't think you fully understood what I'm trying to do. I have no problem publishing build info for Debian packages. What I'm trying to do is to add dependencies to the build info. 'Normally' this is taken care of by the higher-level build integrations but this doesn't exist for Debian builds, but since I know the dependencies I want to add them programmatically during my build.

Thank you for your reply.

You might have missed my reply from Oct 17th regarding this issue:

"During our further testing we were not able to reproduce the issue anymore on the same environment used for the initial reproduction.
To be more clear, the issue with the UI not showing the correct effective permissions is constantly reproduced, however the anonymous user is still able to download the packages.
It is possible that one of the steps taken by me initially to reproduce the issue locally was incorrect and therefore we assumed that the same behaviour that happens on your side is replicated on our end.

I suggest we will schedule another session to reproduce the issue on your test environment, since we know it constantly reproduces."

As we have not heard back from you and were unable to reproduce the issue locally, the JIRA ticket was temporarily closed.

With the above being said, we are now checking internally that the issue is consistent on our end and once we confirm that, it will be reviewed by our internal teams again.
If we find inconsistent behaviour again, we might want to schedule another debugging session in your environment, where we know it reproduces constantly.

I will make sure to keep you updated with our progress.

We are working on setting up the nginx.
- Installed nginx on both Artifactory severs.
- Added artifactory.conf in /etc/nginx/conf.d
- Restarted nginx

Questions -

1)  We are adding above configuration under /etc/nginx/conf.d/artifactory.conf? Does it looks correct to you? The proxy_pass?
2) Do we have to restart the artifactory?
3) How to make sure if the new configuration has taken place?

4) Do we need to use SSL/HTTPS?
5) What SSL CERT and Key should  be used?
6) Any further configuration change to support docker commands or automatically it will switch to 8081 as per upstream artifactory-direct?
7) Any change to docker commands? Docker login artifactory-ha.bcbsfl.com & sudo docker pull artifactory-ha.bcbsfl.com/docker-hub/hello-world
8) Can we schedule a call for tomorrow to close on it?

Thank You

I just took a look at the permissions for
user sonic-financial-integrations. It has an attached role called
"any-remote" which has read and deploy/cache permissions for any remote
repository so should include the jcenter-maven-remote-cache repo.

Does that role need to have any other permissions like delete/overwrite?

Thank you for sharing this information with me.

When deleting an artifact from Artifactory and emptying the trash can, it will not result in immediate deletion of the artifacts from your Artifactory instance, but rather, will wait for the Garbage Collection process to pass 20 intervals and delete them the next day.

Usually, the Garbage Collection process looks for deleted artifacts and verifies if they have any existing links in other repositories in Artifactory (according to the artifacts SHA). Therefore, when a file was selected for deletion, and the file does not have any links in the DB side to existing artifacts, it will remove the entries from the DB and will delete the artifact from the filesystem.

Therefore, you may utilize the Run Garbage Collection REST API at least 20 times for the files to be marked for deletion in the upcoming GC trigger.

Let me know if after triggering the above process at least 20 times did not delete all the artifacts as expected.

Looking forward to your update.

Best regards,
David Pinhas

We suspected this was probably the case, the odd part is this procedure only works for us when using the EMEA.artifactory.aon.com side of the cluster.
We cannot use the us.artifactory.aon.com region to create the federated association, and expect it to propagate over to the emea side.

Hi Adam,

Thank you for the update.

Based on this, is everything working as expected?

To clarify, you only need to call the API on one site and then the Federated Repo will be created on both sides.

I look forward to your update.

We currently have a big issue in our production system.Inodes of our NAS for Artifactory is close to 100% for the filestore part.
#df -h#BISPNASN2006.dom101.prdres:/BISPNASN2006_03/artifactory_hd 9.7T 7.4T 2.4T 77% /mntnfs/Artifactory_hd

For days we are deleting many files to release some inode space but this number never decrease. We deleted 1M files (and clear the trash can) but this never release the 1M inodes we hope.
Very soon our inodes will up to 100% and the system will stop.Why when we delete Artifacts there is no diference in the inodes number of the filestore ? There is no deletion ?
Thank you for your help.Regards,Aymeric MALHIERE - BPCE-IT

Thank you for sharing the support Bundle.
I have reviewed the logs and observed a successful load of the buildSync plugin, however, the shared logs do not contain the initially shared error or other errors related to the buildSync plugin. According to the shared Support Bundle, the current version of Artifactory is 7.27.3, what was the previous version when the plugin worked as expected?
Please reproduce the issue and share with me an updated Support Bundle, as it is essential to review the logs from the time of the issue.
Additionally, I have noticed that the plugin script (buildSync.groovy) and dependencies of the plugin from the $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/plugins/lib directory were missing from the shared files, please share those files as well.
Looking forward to your update.

Sorry for the confusion about the license but if you are not planning on having the older version of  Artifactory running as long term solution, I believe that your sales rep can issue you a temporary license (at no cost) to allow you to migrate your artifacts from your older instance to the newer instance.

Each Artrifactory instance needs a copy of its own license to allow for the application to work correctly.

Would you please let me know if you have any other questions regarding this matter?

Thanks

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

While creating an environment similar to your using the configuration files you shared, I noticed that when the Edge node spins up, it has a typo in its node name (artifactoryi-edge-1). This is configured under docker-compose-edge.yaml:10.


As in every other place the Edge node is referred to without the typo (artifactory-edge-1) and according to the error you encountered (server is not configured), I suggest that we begin by checking if the issue is caused by the typo.

To proceed, kindly fix the hostname typo and proceed with removing & re-adding the node to MC, followed by the required steps to configure Access Federation.

I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

After installing Xray and starting the service, you should refresh the JFrog Platform UI and the Onboarding Wizard should pop. During Onboarding, you should apply the Xray Trial License.

If the above suggestion is not working for you, kindly share the following information with me:

  1.  Which Xray version are you using?
  2.  How did you apply the Xray Trial License? Please share the steps taken.
Looking forward to your response.

Sorry, we will be unable to meet due to our time zone differences. Please note that we do have other support offices around the world that can better accommodate your time zone if needed.

Furthermore, I would like to review your environment to confirm that all the ports that the platform installer configured in your environment will be compatible with the upgrade.

As you may or may not know, the Artifactory/Xray platform installer is no longer available for download from the JFrog download page unless you are using Helm.

Would you please let me know if I could offer any further assistance with any questions you might have or help coordinate a session with one of our other offices to assist in the upgrade planning.

Would you please let me know?



Thanks

This is just a short update to prepare you for the fact that it might take a while on our side to give "real" new. The host running Artifactory 7.x started showing strange problems (which e.g. resulted in Artifactory complaining about out-of-memory) which we have to solve first before continuing with Xray and its connection to this Artifactory.

Thanks for the clarity on duplicated binaries. We feel like the count of duplicated binaries are not small. So, it should be investigated on priority.  New logger has been added and waiting for the reoccurrence of issue. Meanwhile could you please schedule a call which may expedite towards resolution of these issues.

Subject: [#186589] Downloads fails randomly in Artifactory (sharding-cluster)

Hi Mathew,

Thank you for your response.

The fact that you configured ‘redundancy = 1’ means that every binary (checksum) should only exist once within one of the 5 shards. If there is only a small number of duplicated binaries, they might have been deployed during maintenance windows where configurations were different. Otherwise, we’ll have to investigate this behavior separately.

Let’s use this logger instead of the one I previously sent and monitor the generated ‘filestore.log’ log file:



<appender name="filestore" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">

<File>${artifactory.home}/logs/filestore.log</File>

We re-tried using the wiki (Helm Charts for Advanced Users - JFrog - JFrog Documentation) you sent us. 
Here are our custom-values.yaml:postgresql:
  enabled: false
database:
  type: postgresql
  driver: org.postgresql.Driver
  url: 'jdbc:postgresql://thehost.local:5432/jfrogtst'

And the command to launch the Helm chart:$ helm upgrade --install jfrog-platform --namespace jfrog-platform jfrog/jfrog-platform -f custom-values.yaml

Which outputs :Release "jfrog-platform" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: jfrog-platform
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Dec  1 14:22:21 2021
NAMESPACE: jfrog-platform
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
Congratulations. You have just deployed JFrog Platform Chart with following products:
- artifactory
- xray
- insight
- distribution
- pipelines

1. Get the Artifactory URL by running these commands:
   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
         You can watch the status of the service by running 'kubectl get svc --namespace jfrog-platform -w jfrog-platform-artifactory-nginx'
   export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace jfrog-platform jfrog-platform-artifactory-nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   echo http://$SERVICE_IP/

2. Open Artifactory in your browser
   Default credential for Artifactory:
   user: admin
   password: password

Open Artifactory URL in your browser.

When the Helm chart starts, it creates the pods in the image uploaded.
The "jfrog-platform-artifactory-0" pod can't initialize. On the logs of the contain postgres-setup-init, we saw this error:Running init db scripts
Waiting for Postgres to get ready using the commands: "psql sslmode=disable --host=jfrog-platform-postgresql -U postgres -w --version" & "psql sslmode=disable --host=jfrog-platform-postgresql -U postgres -w -l"
...........
[31mERROR:[0m Unable to proceed. Postgres is not reachable. This can occur if the service is not running or the port is not accepting requests at 5432 (host : jfrog-platform-postgresql). Gave up after 11 attempts

It seems that it tries to talk with the postgres Pod, which is not started (because we want the postgres db to be outside..)
We also saw that nothing on the firewall going from the pod to the external postgres db.

Thank you for joining the session with us today.

During the call, we further discussed your use case with the P2 repository, wherein you are configuring the p2 virtual repository with the below URL:
http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen
http://download.eclipse.org/releases/photon
http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/releases

However, when pointing to the endpoint of the Virtual repository in eclipse and we are unable to see any libraries in the eclipse tool, we tried different endpoints and on a different Artifactory, it worked partially and displayed few libraries. As discussed I will further test the use case and get back to you with my findings at the earliest.

Appreciate your patience in the meantime.

Hi Scott and  Sebastian,


Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.


This error is encountered either when Artifactory and Xray are incompatible or due to misconfigurations.


Please share with me Artifactory’s version.


In addition, please verify that the Xray base URL in the Config Descriptor is correct.
To do so you  should navigate to  Admin → Settings → Artifactory → Advanced → Config Descriptor and verify that the URL is configured  as below:

<baseUrl>http://localhost:8046/xray</baseUrl><http://localhost:8046/xray%3C/baseUrl%3E>

If this is not the configured URL,  please update it accordingly.


If you still encounter the error after the above suggest changes, please share a complete Support Bundle<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Support+Zone#SupportZone-Creatingasupportbundle> of Artifactory with me.


You may upload files for us using cURL to our Artifactory SaaS account, using the following command:


$curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187434/"

*No username and password are required.

The pip.conf is from the "Set Me Up", it gave me the port 8040, I just copy and paste.
I tried 8080 but didn't work.

[cid:image002.jpg@01D7E691.6C435F40]

After change the port to 8080, 8080 is listening but doesn't accept the connection, only 8082 works.

I changed the port to 8082 in the pip.conf and "pip install" is working now.

Why the port 8080 doesn't work even it is listening? If 8080 doesn't work, what is the meaning of the port configuration in the system.yaml?

And why "Set Me Up" shows 8040?

I will test more and get back to you.

Hi Sean,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

As I understand switched the Artifactory port from 8081 to 8080, however the pip.conf shows you are pointing to port 8040.
By default, port 8040 is used by the Access micro-service.

Can you change it to point to the Artifactory port? Did you make any other default port changes?

In case the issue persist with the correct configuration, please share with me the following:

1. The system.yaml file being used, which shows all the custom configurations used, including default port changes.
2. Support Bundle<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Support+Zone#SupportZone-Creatingasupportbundle> from Artifactory, so I can check the logs and validate whether the request has reached Artifactory.

You may upload your files using a cURL command to deploy them to our Artifactory SaaS instance:
curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187441/"
(no username or password required)

I look forward to your update.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.


When we delete a file from Artifactory, it is not removed from the filestore, as it might be in use under different paths.

However, once all paths pointing to a binary are deleted, the file is actually no longer being used.
To make sure your system does not become clogged with unused binaries, Artifactory periodically runs a "Garbage Collection" to identify unused ("deleted") binaries and dispose of them from the datastore.

Unreferenced binaries, (including existing unreferenced binaries or artifacts that were manually deleted from the trashcan), will be deleted during the previous Full GC strategy that runs every 20 GC iterations (configurable, artifactory.gc.skipFullGcBetweenMinorIterations=20).

You may refer to our wiki page Garbage Collection, or video guide, “How GarbageCollection mechanism and strategies work in Artifactory?“ for more information.

Following the above, to resolve the disk space issue, please run a Full GC (20 GC iterations) and monitor the system.

Please let me know if after a couple of hours you are seeing a difference in the disk usage.

"I also noticed that this instance has a lot of debug logs - While this is not related to the connection issue, it can slow down the performance. I will appreciate it if you can remove the debug/trace logs if you are not using them."Thank you for bringing this to our attention. These were added during previous debug sessions for tickets that have been opened in recent months. We will be sure to remove them from the logback.xml file.
"Can we check both DB ends configurations in terms of max_connections? If it's a default Postgres configuration, the max_connection by default is usually 100 connections which is pretty low for Artifactory (only the Artifactory service by default uses 100 requires 100 connections)."Yes, we can confirm that these are set to the default 100 max_connections value for both Artifactory instances. Thank you for sharing the KB article link for tuning, we will follow up with the configuration and JMX monitoring recommended in another ticket.
Kindest RegardsJames.

If you're migrating from Nexus 3 the tool should track the migration status of each repository in the repositories.yaml.

Generally we'd recommend running the tool once and deploying future artifacts directly to Artifactory to prevent issues with repeat migrations.

As for adding Nexus as a remote:

When a remote repo is created it creates another repo for cached artifacts.

Example:

You create a remote repo called repo1 pointing at a nexus repo containing 4 artifacts (1.jar, 2.jar, 3.jar, 4.jar)

Artifactory automatically creates a second repo called repo1-cache

You download 1.jar through repo1. This artifact is now stored locally by Artifactory in repo1-cache. The other binaries still only exist locally on the remote source but can be cached by also downloading them through Artifactory.

Once cached the file will be available for download through Artifactory even if the remote source goes down. The file can also be copied or moved to other repositories within Artifactory as if it was stored in a local repo.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions

Thank you for your patience.
Our Product and R&D teams reviewed the reported behavior, and I would like to update you that the behavior is by design. The timestamp of folders is displayed according to the time when the folder was uploaded to Artifactory, the same as during a direct upload, the folder timestamp is similar to the replication time. You may consider using the Federated repositories if the original timestamp is required.
Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

I was able to somewhat reproduce your finding, by creating a virtual repository that only contains my remote docker repository, and I was able get a catalog that only contains acoustics/baketools as expected, however there are still some issues that needs to be addressed :

1 - The catalog does not update when I change the content of the cache. If I pull a new image so that it is added to the cache, the catalog will only still list the original acoustics/baketools. I was able to force an catalog update by deleting the repository.catalog file, but this doesn't work every time and even then, deleting this file each time a new image is pulled is not a practical solution.

2 - When fiddling with the system settings, I was able to determine that the property artifactory.docker.cache.remote.repo.tags.and.catalog=https://mcr.microsoft.com is crucial for this to work (removing it leads to the catalog containing the complete list of all images from upstream). But I still need to understand how this property works. I will  need to reproduce this behavior for half a dozen of remote repositories, can I put a list of all the urls in the value or should I add the property multiple times ? Are wildcard or other magical values accepted ?

3 - I still don't understand what the artifactory.docker.catalogs.tags.fallback.fetch.remote.cache property does, I tried to change the value from true to false and remove the property entirely but was not able to see any change in behavior. Again a documentation would be wildly appreciated.

Regarding the documentation, I have found this page<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuration+Files> that stated that the system properties are documented in the file, but when searching the artifactory  package, this file is nowhere to be found. It seems to be generated on first start but even then it only contains a handful of properties and no documentation.

Thanks

Hi Thomas,

Thank you for your update.

I have looked further into this and I was able to reproduce the reported behavior. When I issued the request against the remote repository, I received the catalog of the upstream instead of the cached catalog. However, when I issued the request against the virtual repository, I received the expected response:



$ curl http://<ART_HOST>/artifactory/api/docker/docker-virtual-mcr/v2/_catalog<http://%3cART_HOST%3e/artifactory/api/docker/docker-virtual-mcr/v2/_catalog>

{

  "repositories" : [ "acoustics/baketools" ]

}
Following the above, I have opened a Jira regarding this issue (the Jira number is RTFACT-26567<https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fjira%2Fbrowse%2FRTFACT-26567&data=04%7C01%7Cthomas.detoux%40desjardins.com%7Cbbb026e297e0445b4cd908d9b410ad00%7C728d20a50b4447dd947020f37cbf2d9a%7C0%7C0%7C637738805980777606%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=tkOJ1Kk1MYuL5Eq0YghF8NcSNePcW%2FOGrqcLtyMGvKc%3D&reserved=0>). In addition, I have created an internal documentation request to include the additional property that needs to be added.

now I tried the upgrade again.
At first I set owner:group on the etc-folder recursive to artifactory:artifactory.
Then I processed the upgrade.
The result is the same as before - configuration is lost.
And look to owner:groups.  Before the upgrade the folder "app" had artifactory:artifactory.

And I uploaded the files artifactory-after-update-2.tgz and var-after-update-2.tgz, which contains the whole folders after the upgrade.

We need a solution to do the upgrade.

Hi Dieter,

That folders (app and etc) should be owned by artifactory:artifactory

What's the exact 6.x ? with that info,  I can try to reproduce this issue if I upgrade from 6.x to 7.12.6?

The proxies are only configured on app servers (Artifactory, Xray, Insight (?)) as they have to reach out.  I think we are getting a little lost here.

The current issue is that the Ansible install fails during "Configuring system.yaml" play.  The error I listed pertains to this, and this only.

Thank you-

Hi Ian,

Postgres doesn't support HTTP proxy because PostgresSQL connections are not HTTP connections AFAIK.
I think you need a SOCKS proxy to probably use that with the JDBC driver using a few system properties according to Postgres.org<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.postgresql.org/message-id/AANLkTi=xL6TOwZ2RbZhp0Fj8xfL8jZqmGpd58e_rjJOd@mail.gmail.com__;!!BqwCqLE!boB26JTR0EU38cBVOvSs2wcOG87KMDuT0eAk_hGWXyS1KOnP3E1SP4iNfkRYcA$>.
I personally do not have experience with working with SOCKS proxies.

I might also misunderstand you and the proxies you configured are not for the Postgres itself but for outgoing HTTP requests through the Router.
You might also want to configure this proxy on the application level (which is not related to the deployment) through the UI, you can also add a proxy<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Managing*Proxies__;Kw!!BqwCqLE!boB26JTR0EU38cBVOvSs2wcOG87KMDuT0eAk_hGWXyS1KOnP3E1SP4jgw8EGyw$> for each repo.

Thank you for the email.

I further received an update from our RnD team, please be informed that the parameter "repoPath" is a  repository path of the file and the repository must be local or cache otherwise IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. Currently, it is working only with local or remote (using the -cache repo), but it will not work with the virtual repository.

And we believe it needs a documentation correction which I will pass the feedback to the concerned team, please let us know if you have any further queries on this matter I will be glad to assist you.

We look forward to your response.

Quick update on the issue. We have 2 build server in DEV environment. Artifactory jenkins version is 3.11 on build1 . On the build 2 server the version is 3.4. Past week we were looking at wrong place . We have Artifactory jenkins plugin installed on the DEV but different version. The user request is going to build1 and the build info is passing some garbage value.

The following steps can be used to verify that COT is configured correctly:

Log into the database of each Artifactory instance and run the query below to confirm the certificates have been saved to the databases:

SELECT config_name FROM access_configs WHERE config_name LIKE ‘%crt’;


The Validate Server REST API call is used to validate COT:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <Token>" POST "http://localhost:8082/access/api/v1/system/federation/validate_server" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"url\": \"https://<TARGET_ARTIFACTORY>/artifactory/api/access\"}" -i

A "204" HTTP response indicates that COT has been configured correctly. The "access-service.log" will also have log entry that says:

Verified circle of trust with server http://<TARGET_ARTIFACTORY>/artifactory/api/access successfully




In the logs, we are seeing "400" and "404" HTTP errors during the validation of the federated repository. We will try to reproduce those errors to see what conditions might cause them.

There is no automation involved in provisioning load balancer. We have artifactory installed on an EKS cluster with the official Jfrog helm chart. We have updated the helm chart with proper annotation and type as “LoadBalancer”. Installing the helm chart creates the Classic LB.

The behavior that we have seen so far, every time, the same load balancer gets reprovisioned and when it reprovisions, the internal DNS name remains the same but the listener changes from HTTPS to HTTP and any attributes that we have added such as access logs gets removed.

What would we like to know is if this issue is occurring due to the helm chart that we have used to provision Jfrog or is it more of an EKS bug?

We have deployed Jfrog on EKS 1.21.  Also, let us know if it is best to use classic LB or should we use application LB?

Thank you,

Subject: [#186851] Jfrog : Production System Impaired : Critical (System down) : Western Union
Hi Karthik,

Thank you for sharing the log files from the load balancer. I have parsed through the logs focusing more on API calls being executed in regards to the "listeners" attributes. However, most of the log traces especially the POST calls which would be responsible for any functionality invocation are not indicating any suspicious action towards the load balancer entity.

The only references we could observe from the logs are related to deployment tasks being done through the Load Balancer towards the Artifactory instance.

okay! Now I understand, the local repository thing was confusing me, I
understood that you were referring to the kubernetes image cache or some
other local repository, sorry for the confusion. So if I understood
correctly, unless we use a remote repo in artifactory that mirrors
dockerhub for instance, there's no rate limiting in the Artifactory side
that limits the QPS. I will then follow your advise and check the
kubernetes configuration, I just found that there is a QPS registry limit
in the kubelet configuration, so maybe that's the cause
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/.
I think that for now you can close the ticket.

Thank you for the clarification and for the help!

The closest to that I could do would be Thursday at 930 am PST. If that can't work, we are completely open Monday Dec 6.
Its rather hard to reliably replicate the issue since I have no reliable way to detect it at the moment other than my customers complaining and then going (after the fact) to Splunk to compare timestamps. I am happy to try anyway but want to reiterate- my goal of this call is NOT to solve the replication lag. There are lots of things I could try to do that. Instead, my goal is to learn from your team how to set up my installation so that I can monitor replication lag, track its changes over time, trigger alarms when it gets over some threshold, and understand what bottlenecks may be contributing to slowness of my system. My problem isn't that the system is slow and crashes all the time (well, that IS a problem) ... but my problem is that I have no idea why, and seemingly no path towards understanding better. 
We could spend zero time on the call discussing replication and spending the entire time discussing metric monitoring and I would be happy so long as the end result is me having the data I need to troubleshoot these problems myself.

Doing very well. Vacations are good to rejuvenate oneself. Enjoy to the fullest.

I think Docker limitation is a new discussion here. From an Artifactory perspective, in case of “cache miss” and the image being pulled from the remote logs will reflect about the image limit reached which is not the case in the reported issue.

For Docker limit, you can make use of manifested APIs requests to Hub will usually include the following rate limit headers in the response:

ratelimit-limit    
ratelimit-remaining

As you mentioned the issue does not exist anymore do I have your permission to mark this case for closure.
And this goes without saying, you can always contact us in case any assistance is needed. Please let me know your thoughts.

Happy holidays !!

We have purchased Artifactory through the AWS marketplace and are using it currently for our platform. We suddenly see a costs of 322.65 dollar on the 30th of November in our AWS cost explorer tagged with: MP:transfer-Units ($). 
Can you explain to me where these costs are coming from? As far as I understood we've purchased traffic costs already in our yearly fee. Within the Artifactory portal I can't seem to find those costs explained either. 
Please let us know if you need any additional information. 
Kind regards,

Thank you for your reply,

As far as I understand you are mainly interested in migrating the old-domain instances to the new domain resulting in Artifactory HA with 3 nodes (3 mounts and redundancy 2).

I have consulted internally and we believe the simplest solution for this set up would be as follows:

Rebalance the existing mounts - first before we continue with the migration we need to rebalance the mounts storage. To do so, please first Prune Unreferenced Data and then restore the balance by running the Optimize System Storage REST API.
Applying this endpoint raises a flag for Artifactory to run rebalancing following the next Garbage Collection.
Shutdown and remove node1store
Add a new node in the new domain
Restore the balance again by running the Optimize System Storage REST API.
-After this step, you should have 2 nodes in the new domain and the master in the old domain. All 3 mounts should be balanced with redundancy 2.
If the shards aren’t balanced do not continue to the next step.
Shutdown the master node and reconfigure one of the nodes in the new domain as primary (by setting ‘primary: true’ in the system.yaml file)
Add another node to the new domain
Restore the balance again by running the Optimize System Storage REST API.


Basically, the above steps will create a gradual migration to the new domain.

Please let me know if any further clarifications are needed, I will be glad to assist.

In going in an editing the system.yaml file to make Artifactory's tomcat adjustments, I'm finding that I'm having trouble having acceptCount updated from the default. I've attached my (variablized) system.yaml, and the resulting server.xml that is generated after starting up artifactory. 
(For clarity, we're looking to update the server.xml to something <Connector port="8081" acceptCount="200" sendReasonPhrase="true" relaxedPathChars='[]' relaxedQueryChars='[]' maxThreads="600" />as suggested in https://jfrog.com/blog/monitoring-and-optimizing-artifactory-performance/.
The maxThreads value is getting updated, but I'm not seeing acceptCount get in there, are we missing anything?

Hi Aymeric,


Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.


When we delete a file from Artifactory, it is not removed from the filestore, as it might be in use under different paths.

However, once all paths pointing to a binary are deleted, the file is actually no longer being used.
To make sure your system does not become clogged with unused binaries, Artifactory periodically runs a "Garbage Collection" to identify unused ("deleted") binaries and dispose of them from the datastore.

Unreferenced binaries, (including existing unreferenced binaries or artifacts that were manually deleted from the trashcan), will be deleted during the previous Full GC strategy that runs every 20 GC iterations (configurable, artifactory.gc.skipFullGcBetweenMinorIterations=20).


You may refer to our wiki page Garbage Collection<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Regular+Maintenance+Operations#RegularMaintenanceOperations-GarbageCollection>, or video guide, "How GarbageCollection mechanism and strategies work in Artifactory?<https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/how-garbagecollection-mechanism-and-strategies-work-in-artifactory-video/>" for more information.


Following the above, to resolve the disk space issue, please run a Full GC (20 GC iterations) and monitor the system.

Please let me know if after a couple of hours you are seeing a difference in the disk usage.

Hi Lior Hayut,

Sorry for the confusion about the license but if you are not planning on having the older version of  Artifactory running as long term solution, I believe that your sales rep can issue you a temporary license (at no cost) to allow you to migrate your artifacts from your older instance to the newer instance.

Each Artrifactory instance needs a copy of its own license to allow for the application to work correctly.

Would you please let me know if you have any other questions regarding this matter?

Thanks

Thank you for the email.

I further checked internally on this matter, currently, the Jenkins Artifactory plugin does not support this feature. The only option is to run the whole build with the JFrog CLI and adding the required dependencies by running the “jfrog rt build-add-dependencies command”  (see “Adding Files as Build” under Collecting Build-Info).

However, if you are looking for this feature to be implemented in the Jenkins Artifactory plugin,  you can create a feature request here: https://github.com/jfrog/jenkins-artifactory-plugin/issues/new/choose and our team will review it.

Thank you for allowing me to ask you a few questions. Before I get to business. I hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

Situation:
Moving/Migrating our system and system repo to a new Window 2019 running artifactory.version:7.25.7
from a Windows 2008R2 running artifactory.version:4.0.0

Is there any known issues from migrating from one version to another?

I have had to try multiple times to import the Repo ( a total of 8 times).
How can I tell if the import is not corrupted? Is there a max import limit? (We have a repo and system size of 277GB.)

I took a look into the logs and I wasn't able to find anything that gave me a solid "Yes this was successful".
Upon looking into the logs. I saw several:

Error: yaml: line 59: found unexpected end of stream
Error: yaml: line xx: found unexpected end of stream
ERROR: The process "node.exe" not found.

What yaml file is your application looking for?


Another thing I noticed is in the older 4.0.0 Version in the Repo you have CentOS, but in the 7.25.7 Version you have Alpine.
Is this going to cause any issues?

I have so many more unanswered questions about how all this works but let’s get a start with those.

Hi Soly,


Here is the requested information.

I am using access token generated from jfrog cli 1.51.0 in the bitbucket pipeline for the server with serverId: zondaurban "url": https://zondaurban.jfrog.io/

For 1&2 -I am attaching the settings.xml and pom.xml here.

I couldn’t download Jfrog cli version 1.51.0 for Mac OS (Version 12.0.1). Getting below error on opening the application after download from https://jfrog.com/getcli/. Could you please provide a correct link for same.


3. I have tested with installing jfrog cli latest version 2.6.2 with homebrew on Mac as in below mentioned link. And it worked fine deploying the snapshot version in the repository.

I then tested with the jfrog rt mvn -B release:clean release:prepare which is  also working fine at resolving the dependencies but is failing only at later stage. I am attaching the logs for same from jfrog cli 2.6.2.

Please suggest.

Thanks,

Kalpana

Hi Soly,


Right now am away from my desk. I would provide you the above details once am back.

FYI.. I have used above command with release goals for publishing the release artifacts with nhslive-parent-1.0.1.pom but that did not have dependencies on private packages and hence didn’t see issue while using above command.


Thanks,

Hi Kalpana,

Thank you for providing us with the information.

If possible, please also provide the below information:

settings.xml file
pom.xml (it is taking from /opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build/pom.xm)
if you download the project and run same steps using CLI from different machine, do you still see the experience the same behavior?
bitbucket-pipelines.yml file
If you have any sample project and if you use a similar command jfrog rt mvn -B release:clean release:prepare for that project does the behavior is same? This helps us to know if the issue is with the plugin version or the pipeline

Thank you for quick response. nhslive-parent-1.0.1.pom is a private package generated by us and uploaded to jfrog-libs-release repo.


I am trying to make changes on the existing pipeline.


Here is the output of the snapshot build that has been successful.

Please let me know if you need any other information for troubleshooting.

Hello Kalpana,

Thank you for contacting Jfrog Support!

Based on the information that you have provided, your pipeline failed at resolving nhslive-parent-1.0.1.pom. Please let us know if this is a public package or a private package.

Is this a new pipeline? If possible, please share with us your pipeline script and the output from the successful run

Hi Michael,

Thank you for the update.
From the shared logs from the primary pod, it looks like the service started up successfully. However, as you saw that none of the pods came up to be in a "Ready" state, we would need to check further into the configuration and other logs.
Please let me know if you're available for a call tomorrow at 11:30 AM EST, and I can schedule a call and send an invite.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

The only caveat I can think of is that I am using the plain text password for the user in question. Are you using the password or a generated API key to log in with the docker client? If you are using an API key, you may need to generate a new one from Artifactory and try logging in again. To do this, click on the "Welcome, <your_username>" link near the top right when logged in to the Artifactory UI and select "Edit Profile". After entering your password, you will see the API key field near the middle of the page, where you can click the circular arrow to regenerate the API key.

It would probably also be useful to review the logs from artifactory to validate what you are seeing from the client end, and also check if there are any related errors or warnings happening behind the scenes. Please either generate a support bundle from Administration -> Support Zone in the UI or zip $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/var/log and upload to us with a utility like curl:

curl -i -T {filename.ext} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/185885/"

Please let me know if you have any further concerns. Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Hi Krzysztof,

Thank you for providing the support bundle, i believe one is from Prod and another one is from Test Environment.

As per logs, I found a connection refused error message to localhost port 8046. Can you please check whether the port 8046 is open or not?

You can telnet to localhost and port number together, we also have an IO exception which shows a problem with service itself however network issue would be the first one.

Could you please elaborate more on next is required?


We did add DNS CNAME record: jfrog.dso.bcg.com -> jfrog-dso-bcg-com.jfrog.net


But seems like jfrog-dso-bcg-com.jfrog.net is not published yet.

Thank you for your reply,

I have further consulted internally regarding this ticket and believe we have found the root cause for this issue.
Looking under ‘router/routes/local’ it seems that both nodes are listed under the same node id:



I have then checked the binarystore.xml file and can see that both nodes are using the same shared ‘data’ folder:

<config version="v1">
    <chain template="file-system"/>
    <provider id="file-system" type="file-system">
        <baseDataDir>/shared-nfs/artifactory/data</baseDataDir>
        <fileStoreDir>filestore</fileStoreDir>
        <tempDir>temp</tempDir>
    </provider>
</config>



Under ‘data’ we also have the router directory and having both nodes sharing this directory leads to the behavior we have seen so far.

While the filestore folder can be shared between the nodes, sharing the data folder is highly not recommended.

Please set up a different data folder for each node.

You can simply update the second node data folder to point to a new empty folder and after restart, Artifactory will repopulate this folder accordingly.

Please note that the fileStoreDir is considered relative to the baseDataDir so you may need to update this path as well.

Hi Krzysztof,

Thank you for providing the support bundle, i believe one is from Prod and another one is from Test Environment.

As per logs, I found a connection refused error message to localhost port 8046. Can you please check whether the port 8046 is open or not?

You can telnet to localhost and port number together, we also have an IO exception which shows a problem with service itself however network issue would be the first one.

I wanted to let you know that I went through the process of importing the Artifactory instance cert w/ the intermediate into the Jenkins master host VM. Having done so, and using the username/Artifactory personal access token credentials set I recently created in Jenkins, I was able to successfully connect, both from the JFrog plugin connection test in Jenkins Global Config in the master host and from the SDK function calls to access/upload to Artifactory through the pipeline which ran on the Jenkins agent. As such, the error we were working yesterday has been resolved.

To make a guess as to what's happening here. I suspect that where other credentials used in the pipeline (such as for SCM) were defined as being local to the pipeline job, the JFrog plugin is only available as a global configuration and is therefore managed by/draws credentials from the master host rather than from the agent machine.

Thank you again for your help yesterday; I feel confident that the issue is resolved and we can now close this ticket.

Best,
Grant McEnaney

Hi Jessie and Grant,
Thank you for your time earlier today. Please find the following summary of our call:
- error happening on build agent, shouldn't be running from Jenkins master
- ssl error even after going through unable to find valid certification path
- looks ok in cacerts file; no errors in browser from cert
- exported all three levels in chain to file and re-imported using keytool (in jdk and jre carets)
- same error
- restarted Jenkins agent; same error
- getting same invalid certification path error testing credentials from Jenkins admin (manage Jenkins) section (using Jenkins master, not agent)
There is one more thing we can double-check to verify which Java installation is being used. If you go to Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration, about half-way down you should see "JDK Installations". This should indicate which Java Jenkins is using. Then, if you go to the project and click configure, there should be a JDK dropdown menu. I will continue to look further into this from this end and consult internal resources, but please let me know how it goes with importing the cert (with intermediate) on the Jenkins master host. Also, please let me know if you have any further concerns. Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Best regards,
Frank Lacour

Subject: [#187310] JFrog CLI removed Docker Artifacts not releasing disk space

Hi John,

Thank you for sharing this information with me.

When deleting an artifact from Artifactory and emptying the trash can, it will not result in immediate deletion of the artifacts from your Artifactory instance, but rather, will wait for the Garbage Collection process to pass 20 intervals and delete them the next day.

Usually, the Garbage Collection process looks for deleted artifacts and verifies if they have any existing links in other repositories in Artifactory (according to the artifacts SHA). Therefore, when a file was selected for deletion, and the file does not have any links in the DB side to existing artifacts, it will remove the entries from the DB and will delete the artifact from the filesystem.

Therefore, you may utilize the Run Garbage Collection REST API<https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fconfluence%2Fdisplay%2FJFROG%2FArtifactory%2BREST%2BAPI%23ArtifactoryRESTAPI-RunGarbageCollection&data=04%7C01%7Cjlawrie%40primerevenue.com%7Cbb4a60c8c6ea479ad02808d9b4d033d9%7C3a707b16081d4cb9be7f6039c780495b%7C0%7C0%7C637739628592090572%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=uyb3vfFWvUzOgrIy0Brh2ZKN261oyDbmo%2Faeb50USHk%3D&reserved=0> at least 20 times for the files to be marked for deletion in the upcoming GC trigger.

Let me know if after triggering the above process at least 20 times did not delete all the artifacts as expected.

Looking forward to your update.

I was able to create a similar environment on my side by doing the following:
Create the package.json file:

{
  "name": "docker_web_app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node.js on Docker",
  "author": "First Last <first.last@example.com>",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.16.1",
    "@cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local": "^0.6.6",
    "@docusaurus/core": "2.0.0-beta.6",
    "@docusaurus/plugin-sitemap": "^2.0.0-beta.6",
    "@docusaurus/preset-classic": "2.0.0-beta.6",
    "@mdx-js/react": "^1.6.21",
    "@svgr/webpack": "^5.5.0",
    "clsx": "^1.1.1",
    "file-loader": "^6.2.0",
    "prism-react-renderer": "^1.2.1",
    "react": "^17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
    "url-loader": "^4.1.1"
  }
}


Create the Docker file and copy the NPM package to it:

FROM node:16

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./
COPY .npmrc .npmrc
RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --only=production

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]

Build the Docker image:

$ docker build . -t davepinhas/node-web-app

Tag and Push the image:

$ docker tag davepinhas/node-web-app davidp2.jfrog.io/docker/node-web-app
$ docker push davidp2.jfrog.io/docker/node-web-app


Afterward, I've scanned both repositories and generated two reports:
1. Docker-local report
2. NPM-remote-cache report

I've attached both reports to this thread.

Can you please let us know what missing violations you see on the Docker scan or let me know if some of the steps above are not similar to the steps you're taking on your side?

Looking forward to your reply.

Are you saying that the playbooks need some editing to define this, rather than using the default hostvars[groups['postgres_servers'][0]['ansible_host'])):5432/{{ artifactory_db_name }} ?  That seems to be what you're saying.


Shouldn't the following take care of this, which is part of the `/roles/artifactory/defaults/main.yml` :
database:
      type: "{{ artifactory_db_type }}"
      driver: "{{ artifactory_db_driver }}"
      url: "{{ artifactory_db_url }}"
      username: "{{ artifactory_db_user }}"
      password: "{{ artifactory_db_password }}"

You saying we just need to provide these variables with values in group_vars/all/vars.yml?

Thank you for the quick responses!

Hi Ian,

I see that there is no connection string configured for Artifactory, can you try to add one?



artifactory_db_url: >-

  jdbc:postgresql://{{ hostvars[groups['postgres_servers'][0]]['ansible_host'] }}:5432/{{ artifactory_db_name }}
E.g:

postgres_enabled: false
artifactory_db_url: jdbc:postgresql://<external_db_host>:5432/{{ artifactory_db_name }}

This is from the deployment, but if you already deployed and do not want to start from scratch you can just edit the system.yaml<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory*System*YAML*ArtifactorySystemYAML-Artifactory__;Kysj!!BqwCqLE!YnjrosdEdq365bKI4zoOJA6uujIeoe7W5Vu5Hv_nB3DmUDUTtzzf-tos2RkDLw$> (under the JFROG_HOME/var/etc:

Checking things internally, we found that we had a similar issue where Postgres RDS may delay in response due to a failure in name resolution.
Is there a chance you observe entries like below in the database logs?

Solving this issue (set the log_hostname option to 0 (off)) also reduced the DB response time and allowed Artifactory to start successfully.

** External sender - exercise caution with attachments **


Hi Christiaan,

Thank you for the email.

I further checked internally on this matter, currently, the Jenkins Artifactory plugin does not support this feature. The only option is to run the whole build with the JFrog CLI and adding the required dependencies by running the “jfrog rt build-add-dependencies command”  (see “Adding Files as Build” under Collecting Build-Info<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory#CLIforJFrogArtifactory-CollectingBuild-Info>).

However, if you are looking for this feature to be implemented in the Jenkins Artifactory plugin,  you can create a feature request here: https://github.com/jfrog/jenkins-artifactory-plugin/issues/new/choose<https://github.com/jfrog/jenkins-artifactory-plugin/issues/new/choose>  and our team will review it.

Please let us know if you have any further questions on this matter, I will be glad to assist.

Thank you for providing this details.

Based on your response, the successfully output that you have provided does not seem to resolve the two below two packages from the outputs. We do not see any reference of these two packages from the output that you have provided. Please verify if this is the same project.

From the data that we have on our side, nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem is not part of wm-nuget. Please find the configuration that we see for wm-nuget. Please verify on your side

Hi Soly Im,

Below are the answers to your questions.  Hope it helps to debug this.  Let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,
Jayesh


Nuget.config

We don’t generate or manage the nuget.config for the cloud.  So default one that would be available on a standard machine.   Since we use the azure task, we have no need to manage this file.

Check if the package is present in any of the repositories under wm-nuget

There are two repos where this package is picked up from nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem and nuget-3rdparty-local-safe-onprem.  However, nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem repo is part of the virtual wm-nuget repo.  The nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem repo is replicated from our onprem Artifactory instance to the cloud Artifactory instance.

Hi Jayesh,

Thank you for providing the error outputs!

Based on the previous two error outputs that you have provided us, it seems like the issue is always with the two public packages from below. Please let us know if there are other packages that is seeing this issue.

 

Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref

Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host.linux-x64

Upon further investigation, you are pointing to a virtual repository called wm-nuget. From our side, we can see that this repository only contains local repositories. Are you replicating 3rd party packages from somewhere else to nuget-3rdparty-wm-local-onprem?

 

<repositories>

<repositoryRef>nuget-3rdparty-wm-local-onprem</repositoryRef>

<repositoryRef>train-wm-nuget-local</repositoryRef>

<repositoryRef>train-wm-nuget-local-onprem</repositoryRef>

</repositories>


As you have previously mentioned, the pipeline works and sometime it does not. However from the last 7 days, we do not see any successful response from those two packages. Please kindly verify if this pipeline works before

We also noticed that you are replicating the packages from your on-prem to local but youu are replicating to nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem which is not part of wm-nuget. From the snippet below, we can see that the packages is being replicate to a different local repository.

 

2021-11-24T17:52:19.297Z|fbc25bc592db63fc|170.74.248.16|replication|PUT|/nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref.5.0.0.nupkg:properties|201|1189|0|11|Artifactory/6.17.0



The reason we are looking wm-nuget is because we see the request hitting that repo:

 

2021-11-24T19:54:00.717Z|d577673ed6e45f22|104.45.180.159|token:auto-created-eon-10180-1612453889.274526|GET|/api/nuget/v3/wm-nuget/FindPackagesById()|200|-1|0|20|NuGet .NET Core MSBuild Task/5.9.0 (Linux 5.4.0-1058-azure #60~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 31 20:34:46 UTC 2021)

If possible, please kindly provide below information.

We have discussed this issue with him and he is aware of this.

Hi Johnathan,


Thank you for your reply,


As mentioned in the previously attached KB<https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/what-is-the-best-way-to-migrate-a-large-artifactory-instance-with-minimal-downtime/>, there is no need to upgrade the old instance as we are migrating the data directly to the new instance.
This is part of the benefits of this migration process, we skip the upgrade process.


Another benefit is that we perform a full system export with the "Exclude Content" option selected which should be a lot faster.


Please review the attached article before doing the migration.

If you have any specific questions regarding the described steps let me know and I will be happy to help.

That's why we needed a workaround for Postgres.

I'll add Dan to this thread as he knows more regarding Ansible and how to develop based on a provided playbook that doesn't have everything we need in there to make the outside connections.  It shows us how the install is done and we can manually do some things in the meantime just to start testing Artifactory setup.

We're trying some temporary solutions and will very likely need some finessing on our side to get the playbooks running with Ansible.

According this documentation https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Xray+Dependencies+Scan, Using the CLI seems to be the only way to have the scan introspect the POM.Also, is there a way to publish the results to Artifactory or integrate them with the artifacts? It seems complicated to have two different methods of Xray-based scanning of our code, especially since the more complex process is the one that is key to our logic. Please advise!

I'm trying to use the ScanNow API call, as per the documentation https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Xray+REST+API#XrayRESTAPI-ScanNow
According to the documentation the post should be:Usage: POST /api/v2/index
For testing, i have tried to scan a docker image and a file. - Both tests return a 404 Error message.
Test1:
msheehan@LTDUB333370:/mnt/c/WORK/projects/days$ curl -u msheehan:SECRET_TOKEN -d @./sent-to-reindex-file.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" https://artifactory.intramundi.com/xray/api/v2/index404 page not found
Test2:
msheehan@LTDUB333370:/mnt/c/WORK/projects/days$ curl -u msheehan:SECRET_TOKEN -d @./sent-to-reindex-docker.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" https://artifactory.intramundi.com/xray/api/v2/index404 page not found
Note: I will append the sent-to-reindex-docker.json and sent-to-reindex-file.json files below

NEXT, If I CHANGE the API Path from /api/v2/index to /api/v1/index I get different results.
Test1
msheehan@LTDUB333370:/mnt/c/WORK/projects/days$ curl -u msheehan:SECERT_TOKEN -d @./sent-to-reindex-docker.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" https://artifactory.intramundi.com/xray/api/v1/index{"info":"Index event has been sent to queue"}msheehan@LTDUB333370:/mnt/c/WORK/projects/days$

Test2:
$ curl -u msheehan:SECRET_TOKEN -d @./sent-to-reindex-file.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" https://artifactory.intramundi.com/xray/api/v1/index{"info":"Index event has been sent to queue"}
So, When using V1 rather than V2, we get a response rather that a 404 message.However, The index does not seem to have any effect. I don't see any XRAY data for the file or docker image!

JSON FILES:
$ more sent-to-reindex-file.json{ "repo_path": "libs-snapshot-local/amundi/sits/gp/diagdon-batch/3.5.3-SNAPSHOT/diagdon-batch-3.5.3-20210525.153313-5-dar.zip"}$ more sent-to-reindex-docker.json{ "repo_path": "app1-local-docker/amundi/investment-compliance-cs/develop/manifest.json"}$

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

I took a look in the logs for this package you mentioned:

I'm assuming that the rogue_one_codefresh user is the one attempting to perform this wget and getting the error. I see the majority of these receiving a 302 (found) response so the request is hitting Artifactory successfully but may be having an issue when following a redirect to the storage hosting the artifact.

Are you using the same wget version on both systems? Since there's a redirect here, the wget client needs to be at least version 1.20.3. Are you able to download the package with curl?

You can find more information about this error here:

https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/artifactory-how-to-resolve-a-400-bad-request-error-when-trying-to-download-or-resolve-artifacts/

Please let me know if you have any further information to provide or anything else I can help with.

Nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem is not part of wm-nuget.  However, I think that is fine because as you said, the packages are not referenced by the project.  So why is it trying to pull it in some times and not for other times ?

We see this for multiple project pipelines at different times.  None of these projects reference these packages.

Thanks,
Jayesh

Hi Jayesh,

Thank you for providing this details.

Based on your response, the successfully output that you have provided does not seem to resolve the two below two packages from the outputs. We do not see any reference of these two packages from the output that you have provided. Please verify if this is the same project.



Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref

Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host.linux-x64
From the data that we have on our side, nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem is not part of wm-nuget. Please find the configuration that we see for wm-nuget. Please verify on your side

Hi Soly Im,
Below are the answers to your questions.  Hope it helps to debug this.  Let me know if you have further questions.
Thanks,
Jayesh


  1.  Nuget.config
We don't generate or manage the nuget.config for the cloud.  So default one that would be available on a standard machine.   Since we use the azure task, we have no need to manage this file.

  1.  Successful build output (for the same project):

There are two repos where this package is picked up from nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem and nuget-3rdparty-local-safe-onprem.  However, nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem repo is part of the virtual wm-nuget repo.  The nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem repo is replicated from our onprem Artifactory instance to the cloud Artifactory instance.

Subject: RE: AZDO Pipeline Build Error

Hi Jayesh,

Thank you for providing the error outputs!

Based on the previous two error outputs that you have provided us, it seems like the issue is always with the two public packages from below. Please let us know if there are other packages that is seeing this issue.










Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref



Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host.linux-x64
Upon further investigation, you are pointing to a virtual repository called wm-nuget. From our side, we can see that this repository only contains local repositories. Are you replicating 3rd party packages from somewhere else to nuget-3rdparty-wm-local-onprem?









 <repositories>



     <repositoryRef>nuget-3rdparty-wm-local-onprem</repositoryRef>



     <repositoryRef>train-wm-nuget-local</repositoryRef>



     <repositoryRef>train-wm-nuget-local-onprem</repositoryRef>



 </repositories>

As you have previously mentioned, the pipeline works and sometime it does not. However from the last 7 days, we do not see any successful response from those two packages. Please kindly verify if this pipeline works before

We also noticed that you are replicating the packages from your on-prem to local but youu are replicating to nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem which is not part of wm-nuget. From the snippet below, we can see that the packages is being replicate to a different local repository.










2021-11-24T17:52:19.297Z|fbc25bc592db63fc|170.74.248.16|replication|PUT|/nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref.5.0.0.nupkg:properties|201|1189|0|11|Artifactory/6.17.0


The reason we are looking wm-nuget is because we see the request hitting that repo:









2021-11-24T19:54:00.717Z|d577673ed6e45f22|104.45.180.159|token:auto-created-eon-10180-1612453889.274526|GET|/api/nuget/v3/wm-nuget/FindPackagesById()|200|-1|0|20|NuGet .NET Core MSBuild Task/5.9.0 (Linux 5.4.0-1058-azure #60~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 31 20:34:46 UTC 2021)
If possible, please kindly provide below information.

  1.  Nuget.config
  2.  Successful build output
  3.  Check if the package is present in any of the repositories under wm-nuget
  4.  provide the packages.config or csproj<https://github.com/santhoshjfrog/project-examples/blob/master/nuget-example/multi-example/services/services.csproj> files that contains the package information that you would like to restore

Best Regards,

Soly,

Hi Michael,

We would like to continue by turning on debug logging for the access token verifier. Please add this to the end of your $JFROG_HOME/etc/artifactory/logback.xml file before </config> :

<logger name="org.jfrog.access.token.verifier">

</logger>

When the next time the issue occurs please send us the updated logs.

In addition during the incident times please let us know if there's any:
- Latency between DB and instances
- Heavy disk usage in DB
- Other communication issues (e.g. firewall?)

Looking forward to hearing from you.

It was a pleasure meeting you today.

During the session, you further elaborated about the current situation where after upgrading your staging Artifactory instance from 7.19.4 to 7.27.10, Access was no longer able to run queries against the database.

As you mentioned that you’re using an HA PostgreSQL setup along with ‘pgpool’, I informed you that Artifactory does not support HA DB setups and is specifically known to cause troubles when using ‘pgpool’, according to these internal, open Jira tickets:

RTMID-14892 - Artifactory create database schema don't work with pgpool
RTMID-12614 - Add support for database load balancing
RTMID-21479 - Artifactory feature request to gracefully handle HA database pod/node failures that cause JDBC connection to break mid connection with artifactory.

Additionally, you confirmed that when configuring Artifactory with the direct PostgreSQL address (bypassing ‘pgpool’), everything worked as expected.

As you mentioned that you were already considering moving to non-HA database setup, we agreed that the best approach would be migrating to a single database prior to the dev/production upgrade attempt. Furthermore, I mentioned that a database migration is a fairly simple process which consists of a DB-dump + import and connection string/credentials updates (system.yaml).

Finally, as agreed, I have thoroughly reviewed the source code differences between Artifactory 7.19.4 and 7.27.10. It appears that within the large number of commits that took place between these versions, one commit includes changes to the flyway library which directly affect the Access <> PostgreSQL communication.

While I can’t get into specifics, it’s very likely that these changes are what's causing the different behavior with ‘pgpool’.

I hope this has been helpful. Please let us know if you have any follow up questions, we’ll gladly assist.

Best regards,
Joey Naor

In the browser's developer console, I see that every time I click one of these headings I get an error 400 (bad request). Here's one of the requests:
POST https://artifactory-test.nml.com/ui/api/v1/mds/versions

It also shows up in the system logs, but with not much more information:Error: Request failed with status code 400  at createError (/opt/jfrog/artifactory/app/frontend/bin/server/dist/node_modules/axios/lib/core/createError.js:16:15)  at settle (/opt/jfrog/artifactory/app/frontend/bin/server/dist/node_modules/axios/lib/core/settle.js:17:12)  at IncomingMessage.handleStreamEnd (/opt/jfrog/artifactory/app/frontend/bin/server/dist/node_modules/axios/lib/adapters/http.js:260:11)  at IncomingMessage.emit (events.js:203:15)  at endReadableNT (_stream_readable.js:1145:12)  at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:63:19)
I can sort by version number successfully, that makes a similar "versions" api call, but it's successful:

{"graphQL":{"query":"query ($filter: VersionFilter!, $first: Int, $orderBy: VersionOrder) { versions (filter: $filter, first: $first, orderBy: $orderBy) { edges { node { name, created, modified, package { id }, repos { name, type, leadFilePath }, licenses { name, source }, size, stats { downloadCount }, vulnerabilities { critical, high, medium, low, info, unknown, skipped } } }, pageInfo { hasNextPage, endCursor } } }","variables":{"filter":{"packageId":"npm://aggregate-error","name":"*"},"first":100,"orderBy":{"field":"NAME_SEMVER","direction":"DESC"}}}}
Looks like the only difference between the two requests is the orderBy field.
I can reproduce this in both our test and prod installations, with multiple package types. I've attached a support bundle from our test installation that should include both of the requests above.

However, when you fetch the latest tag you don't actually get this new release (despite a successful docker push):(lyoung@C02G64Y0MD6T) ➜ ~ docker inspect confluent-docker.jfrog.io/confluentinc/cc-base:latest | jq '.[].Created'

"2021-11-30T20:06:26.005012599Z"
The reason for this is the :latest tag previously (7/9/21) contained a multi-arch image (list.manifest.json) but the newer tag is single-arch (manifest.json). Artifactory behaves incorrectly serving the older multi-arch image when clients ask for this tag:2:06

Well we tried the virtual repo ==> ok
Updates via api ==> ok

So everything looks much better now.

And when looking back this must be the root cause.

Thx so much.

PS one small question (maybe I need to create a separate call for this, the date in the container is ok and set to CET. However when we create a repo it got created by UTC timestamp.

Can we change this ?

I have gone ahead and added the watermark as suggested and will need to recycle Xray later today to get it to take effect. My concern now is on recycling Xray, we were able to get xray up but the process was a nightmare, we would have to restart the service, rabbitmq wouldn't come up properly so we would have to kill rabbitmq. then login as xray and manually start rabbitmq. If that didn't work we would kill all the tasks and repeat the process except we would have to start Xray from the shell script in bin, then again see if rabbitmq comes up if not repeat the process of killing and restart rabbitmq. and that cycle continues until rabbitmq starts working. 
I want to know why that is happening and how to fix it, i understand the need to upgrade an we are working on those issues and will be trying to upgrade again soon, but there is no timeline for that so i would like to get this stabilized first.Thanks,
Jacob D.

Assuming "artifacts.west.com" is a reverse proxy URL, the missing UI component might be failing to load correctly when using when using the proxy.

To troubleshoot this issue:

Not sure if your Artifactory servers are independent or if they are part of a cluster. If they are part of a cluster, can you try accessing each of them to see if the Advanced tab is present in each of them. If one of them does not show the Advanced tab, then the "artifacts.west.com" URL might actually be pointing to that one.
A HAR file capture can be taken to see if anything is blocked. Recommend taking one for "artifacts.west.com" and taking one for "artifacts.den06.west.com", for comparison. This Google article has more info on taking HAR file captures. We can also review the HAR file capture and compare it to a capture taken from a test environment.
Please also try clearing the browser cache of anything related to both of those URLs (or try accessing "artifacts.west.com" in private mode), to see if it is a browser caching issue.

If the following methods above don't identify the issue, please attach a Support Bundle and the HAR file captures to the case to have us review them.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please let us know.

Subject: [#186589] Downloads fails randomly in Artifactory (sharding-cluster)

Hi Mathew,

Thank you for your response.

The fact that you configured ‘redundancy = 1’ means that every binary (checksum) should only exist once within one of the 5 shards. If there is only a small number of duplicated binaries, they might have been deployed during maintenance windows where configurations were different. Otherwise, we’ll have to investigate this behavior separately.

Let’s use this logger instead of the one I previously sent and monitor the generated ‘filestore.log’ log file:



<appender name="filestore" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">

Hi Support,



Our production licenses have expired and we received the new bucket licenses but need help applying the artifactory bucket licenses.

Thanks for your patience, I was out of office for a few days.

Since this is a tar installation, I'm assuming you upgraded recently and followed the steps here https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Upgrading+Artifactory#UpgradingArtifactory-LinuxArchiveUpgrade.1 which performs a
rm -rf $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/app
cp -r $JF_NEW_VERSION/app $JFROG_HOME/artifactory
correct? The issue here is that it overwrites the app directory completely, which should normally be fine since it's just the binaries though any custom contents get wiped. The thing is when installing the application as a service (using the installService.sh script, which allows you to run things like systemctl start artifactory), it copies

$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/app/misc/service/setenv.sh

to

$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/app/bin/

and uses it to handle some environment variables when the instance is run as a service. This includes JAVA_OPTS, and so even though you likely already had "-Dorg.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH=true" (need to see the file to confirm) in the artifactory.default file, it wasn't getting applied because the Artifactory startup was trying to offload java_opt handling to the setenv.sh script, but that was not being found as the app folder was overwritten and the setenv.sh file removed. This is why adding the property to the catalina.properties file worked, as Artifactory itself and not the systemctl specific startup is checking that value. I recommend to run the

$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/app/bin/installService.sh

script again if this is the case, so any JAVA_OPT changes in the future do get applied.

Thank you for joining the call today.

During the session, we have made several tries to further investigate and isolate the issue.
We have created a new remote repository pointing to npmjs with default configuration, pointed the npm client to the new remote but we still got the same checksum integrity issue.
We have also checked the sha1 checksum of the file that was cached in Artifactory and compared it with the tarball fetched from npmjs directly.
The checksums were identical and it appears that Artifactory correctly caches the package and it is not getting corrupted at any point.
Lastly, we rolled back to using npm version < 7.16 (7.7) and we could see the npm install command succeeds.

To be clear, you currently have 4 environments, 2 production clusters and 2 dev clusters.
This issue occurs only in one of the dev environment and one of the prod's, all share the same version 7.27.6.

Therefore our next action items are as follows:

1. Reproduce the issue on the affected dev instance - with npm version 8 and with a "working" version and share with us the full client output (in debug mode) as well as a Support Bundle from this instance.

We will compare between the requests issued by the different clients.

2. Run the same npm install command against a new npm remote created in the "working" dev instance and share with us the debug output from the client side and a Support Bundle from that instance.

We will compare the requests between the 2 servers and noticeable configuration changes that might cause this issue.

Please upload the files/bundles using the below command:

curl -i -T {filename.ext} “https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/186607/”
(no username or password required)


We look forward to your update.

Hi Todd,

Thank you for the update.

Please elaborate on the described behavior. Are artifacts with a supported package type are not being scanned?

If so, please share with me the screenshot of the Xray tab of the related zip.

Additionally, what are the current Artifactory and Xray versions that are related to the behavior? This information will help to verify the shared support_types.json file.

If it is an option please share with me the mentioned zip file, in case it is not possible please refer to the relevant zip -> Xray tab -> Actions -> Scan for Violations, wait for a few minutes, and generate Xray Support Bundle.

I would like to be able to get a list of all followers in the entire instance and what exactly they are following.
What brought this to mind is that we occasionally have some follower notification e-mails from Artifactory be undeliverable after a person leaves the company (i.e. when the e-mail address associated with the notified ID is no longer active). We know about this only because the 'failed to deliver' e-mail is sent to a certain mailbox (which must be configured in Artifactory). Normally, when that happens, we get a handful of bounced e-mail notifications and we just go into Artifactory and delete the related ID to prevent future notifications. However, this week, we had -thousands- of bounced e-mail notifications from the same now-invalid e-mail address. I have no idea what this person was following (maybe an entire repository or maybe several repositories), but I know of no way that I could have looked that up, either for that ID (which is now deleted) or for any existing ID (i.e. how can I know if there is still some ID that receives a thousand e-mail notifications a day from Artifactory?).

We would like to request a product enhancement.
SUMMARY:
 We would like to request the creation of a webhook to inform us when a specific user gets locked in Artifactory.
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 Recently, we had an internal problem led to one of our Artifactory users to get locked due to many incorrect login attempts.
 The error manifested in many different ways throughout different pipelines and was not straightforward to detect the reason of the errors and what user was the culprit.
 After some research, we finally found out that the errors were caused by a user locked out in Artifactory, preventing our pipelines from accessing the required artifacts.
SUGGESTED SOLUTION:
 We would like to request JFrog to create an API that would inform us anytime users have been locked on a given Artifactory instance, so we would be immediately notified and impact could be prevented right away.
 We thought about developing a listener on our end to listen for any "user lock" events that match a given list of pipeline automation users.
 This could come in a form of a webhook, for example.
 Based on the list of APIs present on https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API, we don't think such API exists at the moment.
 We are currently calling "getLockedUsers" in a regular basis using cron, but that's ineffective (since most times, those users are not expected to be locked), resource consuming (having to perform the GET call each X minutes, everyday) and will not give immediate results (we will only know the locked users upon the next run of the GET call)

Before I log this to JFrog Jira, could you please confirm:
1- Is this feasible to be requested as a product enhancement?2- Any other suggestions about this scenario?
Please let us know.
Thanks!
Pedro @ Accelerators teamPegasystems

I have noticed recently that on both of our Xray instances, the online Database Sync never seems to complete. It wil vary in how far it gets before stoppping, and will sometimes do a bit more if you click the 'Start' sync button again....but the best i have managed to get it to is about 40% of late and that can take several days of restarting the sync.
Is there something i can check to see what is going on ?
Thanks.

Yes, your question.
I saw a note saying “Artifactory HA is supported with an Enterprise License. Each node in the cluster must be activated with a different license.” in when I reviewed Artifactory HA implementation doc (https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Installing+Artifactory ). Does that mean our licensing cost will increase once we are running 3 node Artifactory Cluster? Or JFOG will simply generate 2 more licensing file for the additional HA nodes.

Per the JFrog Pricing page - a Self-Hosted Enterprise X license should start with 3 Aritfactoery server licenses. As for how the pricing would be altered depending on if you needed more licenses - I'm looping in your Account Owner.

Hi George,

In that case you're seeing the certificate for *.jfrog.net which is using the *.jfrog.io cert so this is expected behavior.

You currently have CNAME entry in your table where artifactory.inbake.com points at another Artifactory?

Here's an example of another CNAME we have set up:

Checking the jfrog.net CNAME will show the *.jfrog.io cert:

[Image_2021-12-01_11-07-15.png]

CNAME entry added to DNS to point at the jfrog.net CNAME:

[Image_2021-12-01_11-08-02.png]

Checking the certs on the CNAME shows the desired certs:

[Image_2021-12-01_11-08-45.png]

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with.

We've had issues with Artifactory recently (including an outage last night) and have traced it back to high I/O wait due to the heap size crowding out the disk cache. We have 2x 32G instances with heap size set to 24G for them. It looks like we've got an average requests per second around 100, but when we've had issues we've seen spikes up to ~2500rps, presumably due to services attempting retries.
What I'm getting at - what's an appropriate size for our heap? It seems like things run pretty well at lower heap levels for about a week until the JVM/Artifactory allocates the full heap level and things spiral. Could we get away with halving our heap size to 12G? It's worth noting that when we do resize the heap we're planning on setting min and max to the same size so we can have a consistent memory profile. If you've got any information on what Artifactory is allocating on and off heap as well, that would be incredibly helpful.

Thank you for your patience.

We have created a similar environment in our lab with the provided Artifactory, Xray and Jenkins versions.

Installed Jenkins(2.260) and loaded the Artifactory plugin(3.11.4) along with other dependency plugins.

Integrated the provided Artifactory(7.16.3) and Xray(3.17.4) versions with Jenkins.

Here are the scenarios described:

Scenario 1:

We triggered a Jenkins build and published it into Artifactory and scanned it by Xray.

The build got scanned successfully and displayed the violations as below.




<<No Xray “Fail build in case of a violation” policy rule has been defined on this build. The Xray scan will run in parallel to the deployment of the build and will not obstruct the build. To review the Xray scan results, see the Xray Violations tab in the UI.>>



The above one which you mentioned was not any error, it was the expected behaviour. It just says that Xray won't fail any build in case it finds any violations. This happens if we do not enable “Fail build” while creating a rule for policy. If we enable the option of "Fail build" we will get the build scanned but will display the violations as below:





<<"This build has not been scanned by Xray
To index the build, go to Indexed Resources">>

The one more error which you mentioned above happens when you do not add the build to the indexed resources. Because of that scan build information won't be available under Xray data tab.



Scenario 2:

We were not able to reproduce this behaviour as it was not giving any timeout error for us even after adding the policy to the build and triggering the Jenkins build. We were still investigating the logs of Artifactory and Xray provided by you.

We will be further checking on this internally and get back to you with more information.

In the meanwhile, Could you please confirm if these were the steps followed by you to replicate the similar behaviour?

Looking forward to your response.

No worries, I had a good call on Thursday with a support team member Dan Dafna and the support Engineer Shai who diligently went through a lot of potential fine tunings.
We are going to take a lot of those on board – but we will have to re-design/re-architect as the current deployment model does not work for us and rolled over.

Hi Desmond,

Thank you for reaching out.
It is expected behavior that if services are down, Artifactory will not be able to function and serve requests.

I further checked why Artifactory went down by inspecting the logs.
I could observe that before the crash, there were a lot of configuration changes - It is clear from the logs that the config descriptor is constantly being modified by creating and deleting repositories, E.G:

According to the logs, it was modified thousands of times.
The reason this is important is that we have a known issue of a leak around this area.
On every change of the artifactory config descriptor and other files, there is an event generated that creates a fileholder object that is cached in a map structure.
The problem is that this FileHolder object has a scheduled executor but in this object, this object is never destroyed and closes the executor since it's cached.

This means that every small modification to this config descriptor will trigger single thread leak.
We are already working on a fix on it, which should be available in one of the upcoming versions of Artifactory.
For reference, the Jira number is RTDEV-24966 and I already added you to the customers that waiting for this fix.

You opened an additional case on this issue - 187021, basically the error is on failure on updating the build info, but if you will look carefully at the stacktrace of this error, you will be able to see that the actual reason for it is that HikariCP (the JDBC driver) didn't have connection available because there were too many clients already:

Basically, it means that Artifactory opened more than the allowed limit of connections to the DB and didn't release the connection.
This can happen where there is a connection leak but can also happen if there are not enough connections opened from the DB end.

If you run this query against the Postgres it will show you the max number of connections allowed:



show max_connections
And in order to take a look at exactly what is holding the connection you can run the following:




SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;

In order to monitor such things and it will help you for now to monitor thread count in case of the leak is to implement JMX monitoring<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory*JMX*MBeans__;Kys!!AMCWqqRremt4Wx4!ByUL74qPMygi9YbboAdSaWezg4Bu0guaD_VXs6ujrzxaO63VlJkyLaQwnLKBNjrdAw$>.
This is a good way to monitor many different aspects of the application and help out to tune Artifactory later on for heavy loads.
It is also producing good information when required to troubleshoot performance issues (not only this one but others).

Please could we get an ETA for an Artifactory fix version for https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-23903 - this was from a support ticket we raised back in October 2020 and it's currently preventing our users from using the nuget v3 feeds - we really want to make use of the v3 protocol because of the metadata caching, which otherwise isn't present for v2 FindPackagesById() calls and leads to throughput issues across our Artifactory clusters.
Thanks,Joe

Thank you for allowing me to test the reported use case.

I have further tested the use case for multiple iterations by downloading the artifact that exists inside a ZIP file and I see the operation uses a single thread, also I have verified the database resources utilized during the same, and I could not observe any load due to this activity.

Further, you may deploy tar/zip files based on your use case into a non-production environment monitor the instance during the retrieval of the file, and let us know if you have any further questions or queries on this regard.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

We would need to take a look at a Support Bundle to confirm the cause of the issue you are seeing. Based on the provided description, it looks like the shared.node.[id or ip] might not have been defined in the system.yaml file of the Artifactory instance (see the warning note under step 3). If the system.yaml needs to be updated, Artifactory and Xray would need to be restarted afterwards.

If the shared.node.ip is not the cause of the issue, please provide the following:

Xray logs and system.yaml file. These can be found under "$JFROG_HOME/xray/var/log/" and "$JFROG_HOME/xray/var/etc/".
A Support Bundle for Artifactory that includes logs, config files, and system info.

Those files can be attached to the case via the Support portal or using the curl command below:

curl -i -T file.zip "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187480/"

I assume you were not talking about the project name under Jenkins

But with the build name e.g. for one of the build of above project
            2749:XWebEditor-Global:xweb_editor_global:develop

I don't remember we have build name with '/' char. Can you show me an example of what you see so I can look further!

Hi Jack,

Thank you for your patience.

After further checking this behavior and inspecting the logs, we are suspecting the issue might be related to the fact that the char '/' is included in the build name. To confirm this, please let us know whether it will be possible to update the build name to be without  '/' and attempt to scan the build again?

Looking for your updates.

Thank you for joining today's call.

During our meeting, we were able to see that the docker pull was working with anonymous access now. We also modified the docker access method to the repo path method instead of ports.

Now that you are unblocked and able to perform docker pulls, I will close out this ticket. If you have any questions or concerns regarding jfrog products in the future, please do not hesitate to open another ticket.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Artifactory will consider a failed attempt whenever the user uses the wrong password or API key and the following entry is listed in the "artifactory-access.log" file:

With this information, you can check which client is sending the login request to Artifactory.

I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have further questions and I will be glad to assist you.

I have increased the timeout as requested. However, the need to do so is confusing, given we have approximately the same number of users as we did when the last environment was synced successfully (on the lower timeout).
Have you spoken with our support contact Yonatan Brand about this? He believes there may be a critical issue in Access Federation in this area, but wasn't 100% sure we were hitting it,
Currently 1121 users have been synced (higher than before but an way under the tends of thousands we need) - I'll let you know if things improve with the new timeout running overnight,
Many Thanks,Chris

I'm not quite sure where the pdf files come into this, but I'm looking at the component details page: https://msdexrayprod.ms.com/web/#/component/details/docker:...

We're trying to ensure we can see all the npm packages installed in an image, regardless of whether they have a CVE loaded and we're not able to see them. Does the component details page in Xray show the packages in the package.json for you?

Subject: [#186922] Xray Scans of Docker Images for Pypi and Npm

Hi Amber,

I was able to create a similar environment on my side by doing the following:
Create the package.json file:



{

  "name": "docker_web_app",

  "version": "1.0.0",

  "description": "Node.js on Docker",

  "author": "First Last <first.last@example.com>",

  "main": "server.js",

  "scripts": {

    "start": "node server.js"

  },

  "dependencies": {

    "express": "^4.16.1",

    "@cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local": "^0.6.6",

    "@docusaurus/core": "2.0.0-beta.6",

    "@docusaurus/plugin-sitemap": "^2.0.0-beta.6",

    "@docusaurus/preset-classic": "2.0.0-beta.6",

    "@mdx-js/react": "^1.6.21",

    "@svgr/webpack": "^5.5.0",

    "clsx": "^1.1.1",

    "file-loader": "^6.2.0",

    "prism-react-renderer": "^1.2.1",

    "react": "^17.0.1",

    "react-dom": "^17.0.1",

    "url-loader": "^4.1.1"

  }

}

Create the Docker file and copy the NPM package to it:



FROM node:16



# Create app directory

WORKDIR /usr/src/app



# Install app dependencies

# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied

# where available (npm@5+)

COPY package*.json ./

COPY .npmrc .npmrc

RUN npm install

# If you are building your code for production

# RUN npm ci --only=production



# Bundle app source

COPY . .



EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]
Build the Docker image:



$ docker build . -t davepinhas/node-web-app
Tag and Push the image:



$ docker tag davepinhas/node-web-app davidp2.jfrog.io/docker/node-web-app

$ docker push davidp2.jfrog.io/docker/node-web-app

Afterward, I've scanned both repositories and generated two reports:
1. Docker-local report
2. NPM-remote-cache report

I've attached both reports to this thread.

Can you please let us know what missing violations you see on the Docker scan or let me know if some of the steps above are not similar to the steps you're taking on your side?

Looking forward to your reply.

David Pinhas

Yes, as you can see, the output shows 2 valid licenses and 2 expired ones. Usually, you would be able to remove the expired ones from the UI, but there is a known issue that has been fixed in Artifactory 7.30.
For now, you can either ignore the warning message, or remove the licenses from $JFROG_HOME/var/etc/artifactory/artifactory.cluster.licenses and restart the cluster.

So this is how our Artifactory repo looks like from which we try to download, so I would say we are using the correct path:data "artifactory_file" "lambda_Mail_function" {repository = "mvn-csgs-dev"path = "com/merck/csgs/lambda-smtp/3.0.1-SNAPSHOT/lambda-smtp-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"output_path = "${path.module}/lambda-smtp-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"}
So when using curl it is able to map that lambda-smtp-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar to lambda-smtp-3.0.1-20211130.112509-112.jar for example.curl -o lambda-smtp-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar https://artifacts.merck.com/artifactory/mvn-csgs-dev/com/merck/csgs/lambda-smtp/3.0.1-SNAPSHOT/lambda-smtp-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
But when using lambda-smtp-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar as filename in the Terraform data source it is trying to find that file exactly and is not able to find it as that file doesn't actually exist and would need to be mapped to the actual file like in the case of curl download. So I am guessing this mechanism is somehow missing from the Terraform Artifactory data source?

Sometimes because of vim it happens to add some random iI fixed as proposed and I saw that user groups etc were synced and that the edge-node now has the proper UI, so it's a big step ahead.

artifactory-test.eng.medallia.com is not yet a dns record, but I have added it in the /etc/hosts of the container, so it should be able to resolve it anyway.
It would be nice to get rid of any un-necessary warning/error or fix them if possible.
On another topic I have noticed that when I set up the access federation, I can't choose if I want to sync users groups etc.., everything is greyed out

Any way to enable selection?
Thanks in advance

Hello Amit,

  The exits code 137 does not indicate OOM. It means a kill signal is sent, so it could be expected with mongo if it does not have a proper exits logic. I will try to reproduce that.

  One additional issue is that the debug logs rotate too fast. Even though we capture the entire log folder when the API is running, the logs inside don't have all the live tailing logs we see on the call today. To have the logs for further debug and to identify the timestamp of each step, I would need to ask you to collect the logs again and pipe them to a file and share with us:

tail -f xray_server.log | grep thea > thea_xray_server.log

tail -f xray_analysis.log | grep thea > thea_xray_analysis.log

If we continue to see issues, let's hop on a screen share to further look into the issue.  Please also send the returned result for the GET request and provide some times you would be available this week.  Looking forward to hearing from you.

Is the on-prem host you're using an Artifactory instance?
While referring to "recently changed" artifacts, do you mean the artifacts present in the SaaS instance which were recently uploaded. Or artifacts uploaded after a certain date. Please provide me with further details on this.

I am attempting to install Xray for a POC into our environment and we are using a DMZ server with restricted internet access.  While running the installer, it tries to install PostgreSQL from the internet and fails on that step as we have restricted internet access.  Can you please provide the addresses that it is calling to for the Postgres install?  Also, while I have you looking for that, can you also advise of any post installation addresses we should whitelist for xray to communicate to jfrog for updates and vulnerability updates?

Thank you for the response and for confirming that you are not using the "/" character in the build name. Earlier by going through the logs, I found a few errors, which were usually seen when there is a "/" character in the build name so, I suspected if there is "/" character in the build name that is causing this issue.
I also checked to see if the workaround mentioned in ticket 183471 was still in place, and I can confirm that it is.
To find the cause of the slowness, I've added the loggers to Xray service and they will be there for the next 1 hour. Can you run a job now and can you please provide the complete build output and build-info.json file for the job that took 40 min at Xray scan stage. This helps us to go through the debug logs and find the cause for the slowness.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Luckily, we have resolved the license issue. @Marcus Fagerlund<mailto:marcusf@jfrog.com> for compliance reasons, Raj will need a separate bucket of 9. So kindly break the bucket for 33 into 9 and 24 and send Raj the new buckets. We'll take it from there.

Cheers.

When I go to api/gems/gems-apple/versions I noticed that the created_at date at the beginning of the file has not updated in hours.

However. looking at the logs I see the gems-apple indexing completes every few minutes (see screenshot).
This issue came up because a user reported the compact index hadn't updated since August.
I was able to force an update by forcing a manual full reindex on the gems-apple virtual repo, but this obviously isn't good.

When trying to run the rpm version upgrade as we have done in the past, the upgrade does go through however we are unable to start Artifactory after the upgrade. When loading the web app the UI will come up showing where services are at in the boot process. The frontend (jffe) gives an error saying it cannot connect to port 8070. Every other service reports that the jfrt service is not starting. Digging into the logs it looks the frontend service keeps trying to start and failing. We assume that this jfrt service is the one holding everything up but I couldn't find anything for it in the console.log. We were able to roll back to the previous version and bring Artifactory up, we don't have a pressing need to upgrade yet however going forward we want to be able to without issue. As with our previous tickets this is a closed classified system so we will not be able to provide logs. Thank you in advance!V/r,Andrew Curp

After reviewing the provided database queries, it appears that both Artifactory and Xray admin users and permissions are enabled and seem to be conflicting, resulting in Xray admin users not being able to log into Xray successfully.  Were Xray admin users able to log into Xray in the past?  Or is this a new behavior?

To provide resolution steps, please let me know if your organization would like to use Xray internal admin users and permissions or Artifactory admin users who will inherit Xray permissions.

As a next step, please try logging into Xray with the admin user using the updated password.  Then provide an update if the log was successful.

Thanks for reaching out to JFrog Support.  There have been some changes to the UI display of HTML files.  We can add a system property to allow for this within the artifactory.system.properties.

artifactory.repo.browsing.content.security.policy=sandbox allow-scripts allow-same-origin

This should then allow the HTML to be displayed.  This change will require a restart.  Let me know if you have questions on this or see further issues.

*** External email: use caution ***


Hi Jack,

Thank you for the response and for confirming that you are not using the "/" character in the build name. Earlier by going through the logs, I found a few errors, which were usually seen when there is a "/" character in the build name so, I suspected if there is "/" character in the build name that is causing this issue.
I also checked to see if the workaround mentioned in ticket 183471 was still in place, and I can confirm that it is.
To find the cause of the slowness, I've added the loggers to Xray service and they will be there for the next 1 hour. Can you run a job now and can you please provide the complete build output and build-info.json file for the job that took 40 min at Xray scan stage. This helps us to go through the debug logs and find the cause for the slowness.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Artifactory uses IP address from x-forwarded-for header in artifactory-request.log as well. If you're seeing only ALB IP in the request log, that means ALB is not passing that header.

If you capture a HTTP Archive File from an end-user's machine while using Artifactory,  we can review and see what's being passed.

Luckily, we have resolved the license issue. @Marcus Fagerlund<mailto:marcusf@jfrog.com> for compliance reasons, Raj will need a separate bucket of 9. So kindly break the bucket for 33 into 9 and 24 and send Raj the new buckets. We'll take it from there.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Artifactory will consider a failed attempt whenever the user uses the wrong password or API key and the following entry is listed in the "artifactory-access.log" file:

The repository was not created at the remote JPD. The error was/is very confusing.

1)
I was under impression that I would have to create a federated repo in just one JPD and that I just had to select the other JPD's on which I want to have the federated repo available.
Is it correct that I need to create a federated repo on each JPD and then, on each JPD, link all the other remote 'federated repo' , and so on? Sounds very confusing and error prone :-)

2)
Is there a way to control  data replication on a federated repository? ie, event-based pull replication

3)
Are there any plans to make (local) repo replication more flexible? Ie, basically an operator just want to select which other JPD the repository needs to be replicated to - without having to care about other things like entering credentials for each remote.

4) I get similar "read timeout" when trying to set up a Smart Remote Repository

I set URL to "https://artifactory.nuq.ion.nokia.net/api/docker/test6/" (as described https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Smart+Remote+Repositories)

[cid:image005.jpg@01D7E6EB.CFD7D310]
I have also tried https://artifactory.nuq.ion.nokia.net:443/artifactory/test6/   and https://artifactory.nuq.ion.nokia.net:443/artifactory/api/docker/test6/

5) Can a Smart repository use a Federated remote repository?

Thanks again
My apologies for the many questions and issues.

Subject: [#187404] Unable to pair/register platform deployment

Hello Jan,

The following steps can be used to verify that COT is configured correctly:

  *   Log into the database of each Artifactory instance and run the query below to confirm the certificates have been saved to the databases:

o

o   SELECT config_name FROM access_configs WHERE config_name LIKE '%crt';

  *   The Validate Server REST API<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-UpdateAccessFederation.1> call is used to validate COT:

o

o   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <Token>" POST "http://localhost:8082/access/api/v1/system/federation/validate_server" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"url\": \"https://<TARGET_ARTIFACTORY>/artifactory/api/access\<https://%3cTARGET_ARTIFACTORY%3e/artifactory/api/access/>"}" -i

     *   A "204" HTTP response indicates that COT has been configured correctly. The "access-service.log" will also have log entry that says:

?

?  Verified circle of trust with server http://<TARGET_ARTIFACTORY>/artifactory/api/access<http://%3cTARGET_ARTIFACTORY%3e/artifactory/api/access> successfully
In the logs, we are seeing "400" and "404" HTTP errors during the validation of the federated repository. We will try to reproduce those errors to see what conditions might cause them.

As per Managing Backups

Server Path for Backup

The directory to which local repository data should be backed up as files
The default is $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/backup/[backup_key]

Each run of this backup will create a new directory under this one with the time stamp as its name.


Is $ARTIFACTORY_HOME = N:\JFrog in your case? Does artifactory service account user have permission to create that backup directory under N:\JFrog?

Can you send artifactory.log from the last time you've seen this symptom?

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Please note that Xray does not actually store artifacts itself. The majority of space taken up by Xray is on the database, which stores vulnerability information synced from the global database server (often updated once daily if this is not reconfigured by the administrator) and scan results for artifacts that have been indexed from Artifactory.

To clean up Artifacts themselves, this would be done in Artifactory. Techniques for managing cleanup of older artifacts are discussed in this page.

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Managing+Disk+Space+Usage

When artifacts are removed, their associated data in Xray should be removed when the DB is vacuumed as mentioned in this article.

I hope this information is helpful, please let me know if you have any additional questions.

I need to minimize downtime.
Probably the best solution is to move the bulk without any downtime and later migrate only the delta with the minimal downtime

In order to download delta I need a command to filter only the recent changes

Hello George,

Thank you for reaching out to JFrog Support.

I'd like to better understand the use case, please let me know of the following:

  *   Is the on-prem host you're using an Artifactory instance?
  *   While referring to "recently changed" artifacts, do you mean the artifacts present in the SaaS instance which were recently uploaded. Or artifacts uploaded after a certain date. Please provide me with further details on this.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Thanks for the reply.

I would like to know for a way to cross reference vulnerable libraries with where they are used. Can you please suggest how to go about it.

Also, I have many pervious builds, but, still the diff tab says 'no comparable builds'

Thanks

**** EXTERNAL EMAIL - USE CAUTION WHEN CLICKING LINKS OR OPENING ATTACHMENT FROM AN UNKNOWN SENDER ****

Hi Michael,

Thanks for contacting JFrog Support. I'd be glad to assist you with these inquiries.

To answer your questions - I believe these REST API requests will give you the reports that you inquired about in questions 2 and 3. The Get Build Dependency Graph<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Xray+REST+API#XrayRESTAPI-GetBuildDependencyGraph> REST API call will give all the dependencies of a particular build (and build number). The Compare Builds<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Xray+REST+API#XrayRESTAPI-CompareBuilds> REST API call will compare two builds and define the components that have been removed, added, and unchanged between the two. Please check them out and let me know if it addresses those inquiries.

For the issue where you are getting the 'No Comparable Builds' message in the Diff tab - The builds that are able to be compared are builds that are previous builds.

We're mostly just looking for information from the thread dumps, but in terms of debug logs based on the usage of your instance we might see something from the NPM debug logs. Let's add the following to check that out

<appender name="npm-log" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
  <File>${log.dir}/artifactory-npm.log</File>
  <rollingPolicy class="org.jfrog.common.logging.logback.rolling.FixedWindowWithDateRollingPolicy">

</logger>
<logger name="org.jfrog.repomd.npm" additivity="false">
  <level value="trace"/>
  <appender-ref ref="npm-log"/>
</logger>

in case NPM indexing is grabbing too many resources. This will create a new artifactory-npm.log file. Other than NPM, do you use any package types heavily within Artifactory?

Hi Thomas,

Hope all is well. We are currently running our Artifactory Servers as a single node and I wonder if we can build our own Artifactory HA cluster using the our existing licensing model.  As we have the Enterprise license, Joe and I were assuming Artifactory HA is supported. However,  HA documentation indicates that "Each node in the cluster must be activated with a different license". Kindly let us know.

Thanks,

Emre

Hi Emre,

Yes, your question.
I saw a note saying "Artifactory HA is supported with an Enterprise License<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/gY81CVO0OpsPlgj8sz_IGf?domain=jfrog.com>. Each node in the cluster must be activated with a different license." in when I reviewed Artifactory HA implementation doc (https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Installing+Artifactory<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/NybaCR656YFgr5PXT9ZSPn?domain=jfrog.com> ). Does that mean our licensing cost will increase once we are running 3 node Artifactory Cluster? Or JFOG will simply generate 2 more licensing file for the additional HA nodes.

Per the JFrog Pricing<https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/q41ACW6j6OFyjDw8FKSzpR?domain=jfrog.com> page - a Self-Hosted Enterprise X license should start with 3 Aritfactoery server licenses. As for how the pricing would be altered depending on if you needed more licenses - I'm looping in your Account Owner.

The goal is to allow the user to run "npm install" and retrieve npm packages already cached locally, put to prevent the account from caching additional npm packages without the involvement of an administrator. The issue is that this user is getting 403 errors when restoring npm packages on a computer and the npm packages should already be in the remote cache. Not sure if it is relevant, but I did notice that most of the packages have say they were deployed by the user "public_user". Is it possible to restrict permissions this way? Is there a better way to achieve the same outcome?

In mean time, instead of managing two different LDAP’s with two diff domains in artifactory  – In our org , recently VDS is implemented (which includes both companies domains in it) – so if VDS works as expected, we don’t need to maintain 2 LDAP accounts in Jfrog artifactory.
[Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

     *   Instead of ESI LDAP – we tried using VDS(both Cigna and ESI combined domains of LDAP) – it was success, and connectivity is establishing.
     *   After adding VDS, we tried to edit “LDAP Group settings” and changed “LDAP settings” from “Cigna-LDAP” to “Cigna-VDS” – not getting any response while we are searching for groups. Not sure if we need to change any configs in that settings page.

Hi Prathima,

We'll likely need to set up debug loggers to see why the LDAP connection is failing like that, it looks like some group binding is failing. Are the group settings the same between the working and failing server?

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.

On the call, you mentioned that docker login commands are successful if they are run when not connected to the corporate VPN.

We could see the following commands were successful:

We could also see that docker login commands while connected to the corporate VPN were unsuccessful and did not reach Artifactory since there were no requests in the logs.

As a next step, you will continue to troubleshoot the corporate VPN offline and I will go ahead and close this ticket.

I’ve also included additional documentation on the Subdomain method for your information:

I would suggest to create a change request for your documentation.  The documentation states

"It is possible to override the default central server used by Artifactory to provide the checksums by adding the property artifactory.go.sumdb.url.override=https://... to your Artifactory's system properties<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuration+Files#ConfigurationFiles-SystemProperties>. "
I think this is easily misinterpreted to imply that there is a non null 'default central server' that is configured (and perhaps sum.golang.org actually should be implemented as the default within artifactory as well )

One last clarification, If I am wanting my go client to utilize the artifactory as the gosumdb reference, what would be the setting of the GOSUMDB variable that I should make?  Also this information should probably be additionally added to the documentation.

Thanks

Daniel

Subject: [#187454] GOSUMDB question

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for contacting jFrog Support.

With regards to the queries, please go through the below response:
1. On the client-side, you can run "export GOSUMDB="sum.golang.org"" to set the GOSUMDB to sum.golang.org.
2. Artifactory doesn't have any central server by default (null). If we would need to point the GOSUMDB to  sum.golang.com<https://sum.golang.com/>, then we need to add artifactory.go.sumdb.url.override=https://sum.golang.org in Artifactory's system properties<https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuration+Files#ConfigurationFiles-SystemProperties>.

I hope the provided information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions, I'll be glad to assist you.

Hi Jack,

Thank you for providing the build output.

Sure, let me know how it goes after triggering the build. In the meantime, I'll check the logs for this build "62:DataLake:Object:master number 308" and will let you know if I find any lead that would be causing the issue.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Can you please confirm if you are referring to the “Impact Paths” as shown in the example below which can be found under either Application > Artifactory >“Build” or “Package” view?



If so, the Impact path data can also be found in vulnerability reports. You can use the Generate vulnerabilities Report API to gather that information according to your criteria.

You can also use the Get Artifact Dependency Graph API to retrieve a report for all dependencies of a component (rather than just the vulnerable components as is the ase in the above screenshot).  Below is an example of the API command used:

curl -u <user>:<password> -X POST http://<jfrog_platform_url>/xray/api/v1/dependencyGraph/artifact -d '{"path": "<repo_name>/<path>"}' -H "Content-type: application/json"

Results:

{"artifact":{"name":"libxslt1.1_1.1.26-8ubuntu1.4_armel.deb","path":"artifactory/debian-local/libxslt1.1_1.1.26-8ubuntu1.4_armel.deb","pkg_type":"Debian","sha256":"b270b746594e02fcefde7ec488e97396e704faf5cb8d783ddd682e49c281154d","component_id":"libxslt1.1:1.1.26-8ubuntu1.4"},"components":[{"component_name":"data.tar.gz","component_id":"data.tar.gz","package_type":"Generic","created":"2017-04-27T21:06:04Z"},{"component_name":"control.tar.gz","component_id":"control.tar.gz","package_type":"Generic","created":"2017-04-27T21:06:04Z"}]}%

Let me know if that helps, or if there is something more specific/different you are looking for. If so, please elaborate more on the use case.

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

The shared error messages indicate the credentials in use in either Xray or Artifactory have expired. Artifactory and Xray normally exchange Access Tokens to limit the usage of the Admin account credentials specified on the Xray side.
To resolve this, please try resetting the credentials in Xray by using the Xray REST API:

#Get the existing Binary Manager details
curl -u <Xray-admin> -vv http://<Xray_URL>/api/v1/binMgr

#Update the binary manager
curl -u <Xray-admin> -X PUT -H"Content-type: application/json" --data '{
  "binMgrDesc": "Example description",
  "binMgrId": "<Same_name_as_first_curl>",
  "binMgrUrl": "<ART_URL>",
  "password": "<Admin_password>",
  "proxy_enabled": <true | false>,
  "user": "<Artifactory_Admin>"
}'

Also, please try restarting Xray and Artifactory and see if it helps.
If the restarting does not help, you may try to reset the Xray and Artifactory connection by following this KB article.

If the issue persists, in order to understand what is happening at the Xray end, we would like to check the Xray Support Bundle. If you're not able to generate an Xray Support Bundle, please provide the logs which are located at the $XRAY_HOME/data/logs directory. You can use the following command to upload the bundle to our SaaS account.

curl -i -T [filename.ext] "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187574/"

We had a great session with Joe.  We reviewed the watch and policies and also reviewed several artifacts that have violations when the artifact is appropriately licensed.  Interesting observations included that the same artifact in other repositories don't have violations and when the violations are noted the license is associated to a subcomponent (that is also allowed, but throws a violation).

Joe recommended we adjust our allowed license policy to accept Multiple License Permissive Approach and scan one of the artifacts with the license violation issue.  This resolved the inappropriate violation for that artifact.  Many thanks for helping us identify a work around for these weird violations for appropriately licenses artifacts.

We reviewed the definition of Multiple License Permissive Approach in the users guide.  This is not a setting we'd like to use as we manage our FOSS licenses, but appreciate how we can use it to clear individual issues.

Best Regards,
Jack

Hi George,

Since the CNAME is only configured for artifactory.inbake.com (no wildcard) it would have to be configured as the same on both sides.

If you want to use artifactory2 instead we would need the certificate for that domain.

We recently successfully upgraded our Artifactory & XRay test instances to v7.29.7 (Artifactory) and v.3.35.0 (XRay). I've identified a couple of issues immediately after the upgrade and would like to address them in a single ticket if possible. Please keep in mind that we cannot share entire support bundles because of sensitive information at JPL. If there is a specific log or anything I can parse and edit out sensitive information, I will be happy to do so. Please see my list of issues below:
When viewing artifacts in the Artifact Browser on Chrome, the screen flashes on General properties and usually shows a blank screen with only the 'Filtered' checkbox at the bottom. Please note that folders do not have this issue displaying the General tab. Firefox has no issues. Please see video attachment of the issue - ArtifactBrowserChrome.movWhen navigating to Artifactory -> Packages -> Clicking on any listed Package -> Graph, the system hangs and shows a spinning loading animation that never finishes. I have not been able to find anything that correlates to this in the console.logThis is an error I see repeated with some frequency in our Artifactory console.log: httputil: ReverseProxy read error during body copy: stream error: stream ID 422167; CANCELAnother repeated error found in Artifactory console.log: [ERROR][0;39m [215e2f31f781c8b7] [s.MetadataEventServiceImpl:346] [art-exec-8     ] - Unable to send statistics event to Metadata Server.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#187489] npm remote repo does not seem to work on some artifacts

Hi Thai,

Thanks for contacting JFrog Support. I'd be glad to assist with troubleshooting why Artifactory is not resolving the npm package.

I attempted to  resolve the package through my Artifactory and was successful in doing so:



joea-mac:test-npm-pack joea$ npm install primeicons



added 1 package, and audited 2 packages in 1s



found 0 vulnerabilities

In order to better assist, please let me know how you configured your npm client and attempt to pull the package from Artifactory again and then create a Support Bundle. You can send this information over using the following curl command:



curl -i -T [filename.ext] "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/187489/"

You can make use of the Artifact cleanup plugin https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins/tree/master/cleanup/artifactCleanup to make sure the repositories are maintained according to your requirements.
Please correct me if I am wrong but this plugin would not work on SaaS Jfrog right ?

It could be as simple as increasing the DB connections in your db.properties as stated in https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/artifactory-tuning-for-heavy-loads-versions-5-6/ , but currently I'm not sure if the issue is the connection pool or something in the connection between Artifactory and the DB. It does look like you're using the instance heavily (120k authentication requests in 2 hours) so I do recommend to increase the connection pool as we can see it's fully used up (the "[size:225; busy:225; idle:0; lastwait:120000]" line) and then we can monitor the DB connections and see which ones specifically are being held up, if any are.

On the DB side, are you seeing any Memory or CPU spikes?

Thanks for contacting JFrog Support.


"Insight service in Standalone MC will not be functional with Artifactory 7.27.3 and above”

Therefore, it is suggested to migrate Standalone MC to independent Insight and enable MC microservice in Artifactory.



First, to migrate platform deployments and license bucket from Standalone MC to MC microservice in Artifactory,

You should export MC database into a JSON file before shutting down Standalone MC.

eg.

curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8082/mc/api/v1/system/backup/export -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
The backup.key and export.json will be created under  /opt/jfrog/mc/var/backup/mc/

To learn more about generating the admin token, see Generating Admin Tokens.



Second, to upgrade/change standalone Mission Control to Insight:

1.  Stop the existing Mission Control service.

2.  Disable Filebeat in the Artifactory and Xray system.yaml files and restart Artifactory

metrics:

    filebeat:

      enabled: false

      elasticsearch:

        url: http://<mc_ip_address>:8082

        username: <mc elastic username>

        password: <password>



3. Install Insight 1.x. For more information, see Installing Insight.

Do not install Insight unless the standalone Mission Control service is completely down. There can be serious issues if you install Insight while the standalone Mission Control service is online.


4. Enable the Mission Control microservice in the Artifactory system.yaml file.

mc:

  enabled: true



5. Enable Filebeat in the Artifactory and Xray system.yaml files and update the details of the Elasticsearch associated with Insight.

metrics:

    filebeat:

      enabled: true

      elasticsearch:

        url: http://<Insight_ip_address>:8082

        username: <insight elastic username>

        password: <password>



7.   Restart the Artifactory service.

8.   Copy the backup.key and export.json under  /opt/jfrog/mc/var/backup/mc/  from Standalone MC to the Artifactory node inside the folder /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/backup/mc/

9.   Rename the export.json file to import.json

10. Import the JSON file into Artifactory with the import API that reads the JSON file:

curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8082/mc/api/v1/system/backup/import -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

11. Refresh UI and you will see the platform deployment page and license bucket updated.




FYI, I've combined the above process based on the following wikis -

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Migrating+Platform+Deployments+and+License+Buckets#MigratingPlatformDeploymentsandLicenseBuckets-MigratingtheMissionControldatabasetoArtifactory

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Migrating+from+Mission+Control+to+Insight


Hope this helps, if you have any questions, please let me know.

Hi Logan,

Our JFrog subscription has been going well until last week when our
download links started to redirect all of a sudden. For example, the link:
https://openephysgui.jfrog.io/ui/native/Release-Installer/windows/Install-Open-Ephys-GUI-v0.5.5.3.exe
now
redirects to https://openephysgui.jfrog.io/ui/packages instead of
downloading the artifact as before. Can you please advise on how to correct
this, as we’ve had to temporarily switch back to Github Release links to
mitigate this.

Thanks,

Pavel

Hi Pavel,

You’ve already enjoyed a full month with your JFrog subscription -
congratulations!

At about a month, I’m usually asked about going a little deeper into the
Platform and how you can take next steps. I’d personally recommend you take
a look at:


   - Continuous pipeline security with *JFrog Xray*. It gives you an
   integrated way to scan, remediate and set business rules around security
   vulnerabilities and license compliance issues in your packages. You can see
   more about it here
   <https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Xray>, but I’m
   happy to give you any other pointers.


   - Centralized CI/CD functionality with *JFrog Pipelines* that allows you
   to create custom, repeatable steps for your pipeline and apply those across
   your projects. This helps you eliminate silos and standardize  your
   automation tasks easily. You can learn more on getting started via this
   link <https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Pipelines>.


Let me know how else I can help.

Thanks,
Logan

This worked in March.  A different contractor maintained the system from march through August.  We have maintained it since August. We have not been able to administer xray since.

The admin user had been renamed xadmin.  We have been able to login, but not get the Admin icon.
We reverted to the old artifactoryadmin database password.

Do you want me to send logs after I login to xray as xadmin?  Which ones.

We would like to use the  Artifactory admin users, if that is possible.  Since xray admin users do not have admin capability now, and we can’t see which users exist,  I would not want to depend on the xray users.

Hi Thomas,

After reviewing the provided database queries, it appears that both Artifactory and Xray admin users and permissions are enabled and seem to be conflicting, resulting in Xray admin users not being able to log into Xray successfully.  Were Xray admin users able to log into Xray in the past?  Or is this a new behavior?

To provide resolution steps, please let me know if your organization would like to use Xray internal admin users and permissions < Caution-https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/XRAY2X/Permissions >  or Artifactory admin users < Caution-https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF6X/Managing+Users >  who will inherit Xray permissions.

As a next step, please try logging into Xray with the admin user using the updated password.  Then provide an update if the log was successful.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Sophie Tait

Hi,



We are having issues uploading large files to our JFrog Artifactory repositories. The attached screenshots show timeout errors when attempting this operation. We have confirmed that our environment can handle up to 2GB files or 2048MB. This setting is when uploading files via the UI. Is there another setting for this parameter when using the CLI?



Thanks,

Luckily, we have resolved the license issue. @Marcus Fagerlund<mailto:marcusf@jfrog.com> for compliance reasons, Raj will need a separate bucket of 9. So kindly break the bucket for 33 into 9 and 24 and send Raj the new buckets. We'll take it from there.



Cheers.

Hi Brandy,

I'm still looking through the logs but I'm seeing a couple key issues. The DB connection to Artifactory seems to be unstable. We see lots of

but it's more rare and unless it's holding up connections on the DB side it doesn't look to be the issue.

It could be as simple as increasing the DB connections in your db.properties as stated in https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/artifactory-tuning-for-heavy-loads-versions-5-6/<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__jfrog.com_knowledge-2Dbase_artifactory-2Dtuning-2Dfor-2Dheavy-2Dloads-2Dversions-2D5-2D6_&d=DwMCAw&c=1hIq-C3ayh4zm6RZ7m4R2A&r=pLVmWfCiLZNfSY4RMFYNeLSCzVtVxX-FNXX9EA37E84&m=JaEr-C0QgR6tLvLirEqr-v6I0LVGj9J1sr_nSYLFWa8&s=XjKnjfz8vuvjp8wou4IfLpss-poPi5XduqCTFEQyZGQ&e=> , but currently I'm not sure if the issue is the connection pool or something in the connection between Artifactory and the DB. It does look like you're using the instance heavily (120k authentication requests in 2 hours) so I do recommend to increase the connection pool as we can see it's fully used up (the "[size:225; busy:225; idle:0; lastwait:120000]" line) and then we can monitor the DB connections and see which ones specifically are being held up, if any are.

On the DB side, are you seeing any Memory or CPU spikes?

What I want to verify is about the CVE usage.
As I know, Xray doesn't use today the CVE-ID as the primary key of the violation, but use an internal ID. One of the reasons I've been told in the past, it's because not every vulnerability has a CVE necessarily.
So I want to validate it again.

Thanks

Hi Moti,

Thank you for your patience.

I have further worked internally regarding your query, Xray will detect the vulnerabilities based on the CVE data if there is no CVE associated with a package Xray will not detect the same. However, you can block download/retrieval of a package by setting include/exclude patterns for remote repositories which will help in preventing Artifactory applications from searching these packages at the remote registry end as this will help in avoiding possible security risks.

You can configure the include/exclude patterns for a repository by navigating from JFrog UI -> Administration -> Repositories -> Click on the repository-name -> Basic tab as shown in the below screenshot:
[Image_2021-11-29_14-53-25.png]

For more details and advantages of the repository include/exclude patterns, I would request you refer to the below articles:

We have an Artifactory QA environment that is active-active in two AWS regions. We set up SAML login in both HA clusters. "Auto redirect login link to SAML login" option is also enabled. Our IdP is provided a primary cross-region url to send back SAML response. We can log in to Artifactory from the primary cross-region url. However, when I re-log in Artifactory after being logged-out due to inactivity, SAML login occasionally fails. On failed logging cases, I was still redirected to SAML login page as expected and was authenticated successfully (The PingID showed a successful verification UI page). After that, the browser redirected me back to Artifactory and showed the error below at the URL path : "<Artifactory domain>/ui/api/v1/auth/saml/loginResponse" A temporary work around is to re-open and re-log in Artifactory in a new tab or in an incognito window. I'm thinking if it is possible that an Artifactory cluster in one region initiates the SAML login flow and the SAML response is sent back to Artifactory cluster in the other region.
Th support bundles of two stacks (east and west) would be uploaded to this ticket. The SAML login failure occurred around 12 pm CST (US central time)

Thanks for sharing this. I'm looking to try this out, and it looks like the place to configure this is in the remote repo settings "Edit nuget repository", where I see a section called "NuGet settings" (I've attached a screenshot). I assume if I change both 'v2's here to 'v3', that should be the fix you're suggesting. Is that correct? Since our builds go through artifactory and use NuGet as a remote repo, I think this is correct but want to double check with you.

Thanks,
Judson

Subject: [EXTERNAL] [#182293] Error NU1101 For Packages that Exist


Hi Judson,

Thanks for allowing me the time to investigate this issue. After investigation and discussing this issue internally, it seems that there may be an internal JIRA that resembles this - where Artifactory is unable to retrieve Nuget packages intermittently. However, there is a workaround. You can configure your NuGet client in the build tool to use the V3 protocol instead of the V2. Please let me know if this is a viable workaround, or if you need assistance with this.


Best regards,

The ZIP files not being removed usually indicates that the database sync is not completing successfully. As part of the sync process, the ZIP files are download, decompressed to JSON files, persisted to the database, and then deleted. You can check the status of the DB sync in the Administration module > Xray > Database Sync page. If the status shows the DB sync is in progress but looks stuck, please try aborting the sync and restarting it.

If the issue persists, we can take a closer look at logs to determine the cause of the issue. If needed, please attach a Support Bundle via the Support portal or using the curl command below.

curl -i -T {filename} "https://supportlogs.jfrog.com/logs/186943/"


If the logs show the DB sync process is hanging, we can provide directions for re-invoking the process. If there is another cause for the files not being cleaned up, the logs should provide clues about that as well.

If you have any additional concerns or questions, please let us know.

Your version of Artifactory is a little different from ours as we are do not see the same information on the component (We are running Artifactory 7.21.8 and Xray  3.29.0)

We were hoping we could produce something like what appears in the Descendants  tab 2 over from the example you are showing us in the Security Tab.

Hello Hector,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

Can you please confirm if you are referring to the “Impact Paths” as shown in the example below which can be found under either Application > Artifactory >“Build” or “Package” view?

[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nbnZk3puNmJlXoAIOvpLoOm2GSUZwCsgKeFDJb5s9s81aequ9XkG_3Je3n5pLISVjq3Hl0JASsMphrlyboAWg28uQxXmGxIzAEJGGGZXvB4As-lSIFjABRgUUgZ3_wimEyi-sY2N]

If so, the Impact path data can also be found in vulnerability reports. You can use the Generate vulnerabilities Report API<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/wiki-int.jfrog.org/display/JFROG/Xray*REST*API*XrayRESTAPI-REPORTS__;Kysj!!P0kg3YazkQ!QR3oYNLcMWuMPEhRXgYVwZRqL9qFVFXawBLTcFvxQZNgE-6mOOmcVAT9ddQoXh_QX3-V6w$> to gather that information according to your criteria.

You can also use the Get Artifact Dependency Graph API<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/wiki-int.jfrog.org/display/JFROG/Xray*REST*API*XrayRESTAPI-GetArtifactDependencyGraph__;Kysj!!P0kg3YazkQ!QR3oYNLcMWuMPEhRXgYVwZRqL9qFVFXawBLTcFvxQZNgE-6mOOmcVAT9ddQoXh_EAH-Jng$> to retrieve a report for all dependencies of a component (rather than just the vulnerable components as is the ase in the above screenshot).  Below is an example of the API command used:

curl -u <user>:<password> -X POST http://<jfrog_platform_url>/xray/api/v1/dependencyGraph/artifact<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/*3Cjfrog_platform_url*3E/xray/api/v1/dependencyGraph/artifact__;JSU!!P0kg3YazkQ!QR3oYNLcMWuMPEhRXgYVwZRqL9qFVFXawBLTcFvxQZNgE-6mOOmcVAT9ddQoXh88DDORuA$> -d '{"path": "<repo_name>/<path>"}' -H "Content-type: application/json"

Results:

{"artifact":{"name":"libxslt1.1_1.1.26-8ubuntu1.4_armel.deb","path":"artifactory/debian-local/libxslt1.1_1.1.26-8ubuntu1.4_armel.deb","pkg_type":"Debian","sha256":"b270b746594e02fcefde7ec488e97396e704faf5cb8d783ddd682e49c281154d","component_id":"libxslt1.1:1.1.26-8ubuntu1.4"},"components":[{"component_name":"data.tar.gz","component_id":"data.tar.gz","package_type":"Generic","created":"2017-04-27T21:06:04Z"},{"component_name":"control.tar.gz","component_id":"control.tar.gz","package_type":"Generic","created":"2017-04-27T21:06:04Z"}]}%

Let me know if that helps, or if there is something more specific/different you are looking for. If so, please elaborate more on the use case.

Thank you for getting back to me, I apologize for the delayed response myself here, there were some internal issues.

The timestamp is added each time to signify the date the vulnerabilities were published.

Instead of updating the CRON job, I would add a delete line to the end of the script so that once the copy to the other server is complete, the files will no longer be present. As such, each time the script is run, there will be only one vuln and one comp file present, so instead of adding in the new timestamp, you could substitute a wildcard, which will ensure the files are synced every time.

I hope this information is helpful, please let me know if you have any further questions.

Check if the package is present in any of the repositories under wm-nuget

There are two repos where this package is picked up from nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem and nuget-3rdparty-local-safe-onprem.  However, nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem repo is part of the virtual wm-nuget repo.  The nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem repo is replicated from our onprem Artifactory instance to the cloud Artifactory instance.

Hi Jayesh,

Thank you for providing the error outputs!

Based on the previous two error outputs that you have provided us, it seems like the issue is always with the two public packages from below. Please let us know if there are other packages that is seeing this issue.

 

Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref

Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host.linux-x64

Upon further investigation, you are pointing to a virtual repository called wm-nuget. From our side, we can see that this repository only contains local repositories. Are you replicating 3rd party packages from somewhere else to nuget-3rdparty-wm-local-onprem?

 

<repositories>

<repositoryRef>nuget-3rdparty-wm-local-onprem</repositoryRef>

<repositoryRef>train-wm-nuget-local</repositoryRef>

<repositoryRef>train-wm-nuget-local-onprem</repositoryRef>

</repositories>


As you have previously mentioned, the pipeline works and sometime it does not. However from the last 7 days, we do not see any successful response from those two packages. Please kindly verify if this pipeline works before

We also noticed that you are replicating the packages from your on-prem to local but youu are replicating to nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem which is not part of wm-nuget. From the snippet below, we can see that the packages is being replicate to a different local repository.

 

2021-11-24T17:52:19.297Z|fbc25bc592db63fc|170.74.248.16|replication|PUT|/nuget-3rdparty-local-onprem/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref.5.0.0.nupkg:properties|201|1189|0|11|Artifactory/6.17.0



The reason we are looking wm-nuget is because we see the request hitting that repo:

 

2021-11-24T19:54:00.717Z|d577673ed6e45f22|104.45.180.159|token:auto-created-eon-10180-1612453889.274526|GET|/api/nuget/v3/wm-nuget/FindPackagesById()|200|-1|0|20|NuGet .NET Core MSBuild Task/5.9.0 (Linux 5.4.0-1058-azure #60~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 31 20:34:46 UTC 2021)

If possible, please kindly provide below information.

Nuget.config
Successful build output
Check if the package is present in any of the repositories under wm-nuget
provide the packages.config or csproj files that contains the package information that you would like to restore

Hello Venkata,

We have enabled debug logger for an hour. Please let us know if there was any changes to your build since last night.
Since yesterday, we were able to successfully build with no issue. Is there any changes or specific pattern that you are noticing?

We were not able to reproduce the issue during the 2 hours.   Can we setup a call next time this happens ?   We would probably do that during EST hours.   If so, can I get a number to call ?

You can make use of AQL to get the list of files created a day ago in a repository this using REST API . As an example you can make use of the following:

aql.json
items.find({"repo" : "jfrog-logs"},{"created" : {"$last" : "7d"}})

curl -u<Username:Password> https://<SERVER_NAME>.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/search/aql -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d @aql.json

{
"results" : [ {
"repo" : "jfrog-logs",
"path" : "artifactory/2021-11-24",
"name" : "po2-artifact-access-request.2021-11-24T22-34-05.372.log.gz",
"type" : "file",
"size" : 2603135,
"created" : "2021-11-24T22:34:57.668Z",
"created_by" : "_system_",
"modified" : "2021-11-24T22:34:57.427Z",
"modified_by" : "_system_",
"updated" : "2021-11-24T22:34:57.670Z"
}

Based on the results which has the property "path" and"name" you can perform a simple curl GET to download the files. For any further constructions on the query you can make use of this Wiki( https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+Query+Language ).

So Few questions 1) Does Xray takes down the artifactory ? I've observed artifactory going down when there are issues in xray service startup etc..2) Can artifactory and Xray use the same database we already have artifactory setup which is up and running and being in use for almost yrs. Can we just launch a stack for Xray install and point it to the same DB or Xray should be a separate project altogether?3) Any documentation available for setting up Xray policies, rules and as well setting up container life cycle management based on Xray scan output

Glad to hear the upgrade went fine.  With the licenses being attached, we can attach licenses to instances even if they are not being used.  We can check the file on the filesystem to look further into the attached licenses.  There is no API to check where traffic is being served, but we can tail the request logs of both nodes and run a few requests to ensure both are accurately receiving requests.  Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thank you for getting back to me.

From what I can tell, Artifactory is properly recognizing those as Docker images.

I would like to focus on the indexing task at hand, since the database storage is below our recommended requirements and will need to be increased in prod.

Please try to force a reindexing of the manifest.json file of one of the unindexed docker images and let me know if successful.

https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Xray+REST+API#XrayRESTAPI-ForceReindex

If it is not successful, please share a new support bundle so that I may check for any errors.

It says the default is 98, but I see nothing configured in that db file for pool.max.size.  Here are the contents of that db file:

type=derby
url=jdbc:derby:/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/derby;create=true
driver=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver

## Determines where the actual artifacts binaries are stored. Available options:
## filesystem - binaries are stored in the filesystem (recommended, default)
## fullDb     - binaries are stored as blobs in the db, filesystem is used for caching
## cachedFS   - binaries are stored in the filesystem, but a front cache (with faster access) is added
## IMPORTANT NOTE: This property should not be change after the initial setup. To change binaries storage you have to export and import
#binary.provider.type=filesystem

## Determines the maximum filesystem cache size in bytes when using binary provider type fullDb or cachedFS. Default is 5GB
## Supported units are TB (terabytes), GB (gigabytes), MB (megabytes) and KB (kilobytes)
#binary.provider.cache.maxSize=5GB
db.home=/opt/jfrog/artifactory/data/derby

Hi Kalpana,

M2_HOME is a maven home location and is not related to Jfrog. Please find below article for reference.

In order to expedite this issue, we would like to schedule a session with you to gather more information. Would you be available tomorrow from 11:00 to 12:00 EST?

Hi Soly,


I am able to run it with permissions udpated. I am trying to execute the command ./jfrog rt mvn -B release:clean release:prepare but it is asking to set M2_HOME environment variable. Is there an environmental variable for M2_HOME that I can configure for jfrog.

Hi Soly,


Here is the requested information.

I am using access token generated from jfrog cli 1.51.0 in the bitbucket pipeline for the server with serverId: zondaurban "url": https://zondaurban.jfrog.io/

For 1&2 -I am attaching the settings.xml and pom.xml here.

I couldn’t download Jfrog cli version 1.51.0 for Mac OS (Version 12.0.1). Getting below error on opening the application after download from https://jfrog.com/getcli/. Could you please provide a correct link for same.


3. I have tested with installing jfrog cli latest version 2.6.2 with homebrew on Mac as in below mentioned link. And it worked fine deploying the snapshot version in the repository.

I then tested with the jfrog rt mvn -B release:clean release:prepare which is  also working fine at resolving the dependencies but is failing only at later stage. I am attaching the logs for same from jfrog cli 2.6.2.

Please suggest.

Thanks,

Kalpana

Hi Soly,


Right now am away from my desk. I would provide you the above details once am back.

FYI.. I have used above command with release goals for publishing the release artifacts with nhslive-parent-1.0.1.pom but that did not have dependencies on private packages and hence didn’t see issue while using above command.

Hi Kalpana,

Thank you for providing us with the information.

If possible, please also provide the below information:

settings.xml file
pom.xml (it is taking from /opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build/pom.xm)
if you download the project and run same steps using CLI from different machine, do you still see the experience the same behavior?
bitbucket-pipelines.yml file
If you have any sample project and if you use a similar command jfrog rt mvn -B release:clean release:prepare for that project does the behavior is same? This helps us to know if the issue is with the plugin version or the pipeline

Hello Kalpana,

Thank you for contacting Jfrog Support!

Based on the information that you have provided, your pipeline failed at resolving nhslive-parent-1.0.1.pom. Please let us know if this is a public package or a private package.

Is this a new pipeline? If possible, please share with us your pipeline script and the output from the successful run

Xray will scan builds and this is the best way to ensure all dependencies referenced within the build will be scanned.  This is outlined a bit in the following link:

The JFrog CLI does have a way of scanning the transitive dependencies, but this is output within the CLI and would not show the scan results within Artifactory/Xray.

The errors you are seeing in the logs are a known issue. We have an internal JIRA and are looking into this internally. We do not have a workaround as of yet. Let me know if you face any functionality issues. The errors should be safe to ignore.

Regarding the greyed-out selection, you need to uncheck "tokens" to be able to disable permissions. While for Groups you need to disable permissions. Below is a screenshot that might explain this better.

You can make use of AQL to get the list of files modified a day ago in a repository this using REST API . As an example you can make use of the following:

aql.json
items.find({"repo" : "jfrog-logs"},{"modified" : {"$last" : "7d"}})

curl -u<Username:Password> https://<SERVER_NAME>.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/search/aql -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d @aql.json

{
"results" : [ {
"repo" : "jfrog-logs",
"path" : "artifactory/2021-11-24",
"name" : "po2-artifact-access-request.2021-11-24T22-34-05.372.log.gz",
"type" : "file",
"size" : 2603135,
"created" : "2021-11-24T22:34:57.668Z",
"created_by" : "_system_",
"modified" : "2021-11-24T22:34:57.427Z",
"modified_by" : "_system_",
"updated" : "2021-11-24T22:34:57.670Z"
}

Based on the results which has the property "path" and"name" you can perform a simple curl GET to download the files. For any further constructions on the query you can make use of this Wiki( https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+Query+Language ).

We will then send test traffic to it and evaluate the results. If all looks good, we'll put it back into the LB and have it take normal traffic. Continue monitoring. This is where we would hope to detect any negative impact from the change. Once we are satisfied, we would update the Primary and do a rolling restart of the cluster. The restart would be gradual and we would continue monitoring for possible negative impacts.

The default is 98, which is what it's set to if it's not explicitly set to another value. In this case in the MRA container, it's not set so it's using the defaults.

I was looking more into the primary Artifactory, which has it set to 225

type=mysql
driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
url=jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/artdb?characterEncoding=UTF-8&elideSetAutoCommits=true&useSSL=false
#url=jdbc:mysql://mysql-1.artifactory-mysql-obc.rancher.internal:3306/artdb?characterEncoding=UTF-8&elideSetAutoCommits=true&useSSL=false

username=root
pool.max.active=225

and we can see in the logs all 225 are being used.

Hi Gary,

Thanks for hopping on with me today.  We are still seeing 403s when requesting the target instance's repositories.  We will need to gain access to the source server to further troubleshoot the plugin.  I was able to verify this setup should work as we expect.  You can use the link below to setup a call with myself and someone from the source instance.

   Click here<https://jfrog.com/schedule-support-session/?fld3=5006900003je1Fj&fld7=rty&fld19=o> to book a session with JFrog Support Team.

Looking forward to further debugging with you all around the migration.

After taking the "A" node offline I was able to restart the sync. It did say that it was the initial sync which was odd, and the proceeded to run for a bit and then fail again. It now says "Data sync from global database server has paused".

Thanks for update.


replications_errors table should be like in 7.5.8


CREATE TABLE `replication_errors` (

`error_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,

`first_error_time` bigint(20) NOT NULL,

`last_error_time` bigint(20) NOT NULL,

`error_count` smallint(6) NOT NULL,

`error_message` varchar(4000) NOT NULL,

`replication_key` varchar(255) NOT NULL,

`task_time` bigint(20) NOT NULL,

`task_type` smallint(6) NOT NULL,

`task_path` varchar(1344) NOT NULL,

PRIMARY KEY (`error_id`),

KEY `replication_errors_rep_key_idx` (`replication_key`)

) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;


It seemed that the following mysql_v224_change_replication_errors_to_node_event_errors.sql query was already executed (especially ALTER TABLE xxx parts )  partially before running RENAME table replication_errors

Unfortunately, there was no way to rollback to already executed schema change below 7.27.3 in Artifactory upgrade process.

To re-try the upgrade attempt, you should restore the DB snapshot again to match the above replicatioin_errors table again.


mysql_v224_change_replication_errors_to_node_event_errors.sql

ALTER TABLE replication_errors CHANGE replication_key operation_key VARCHAR(255);

ALTER TABLE replication_errors CHANGE task_time event_time BIGINT NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE replication_errors CHANGE task_type event_type SMALLINT NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE replication_errors CHANGE task_path path VARCHAR(1344) NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE replication_errors ADD event_category VARCHAR (225);

RENAME TABLE replication_errors TO node_events_errors;

UPDATE node_events_errors SET event_category = 'REPLICATION' WHERE event_category IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE node_events_errors MODIFY event_category VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;

UPDATE node_events_errors SET event_type = 1 WHERE event_type = 2;

DROP INDEX replication_errors_rep_key_idx ON node_events_errors;

CREATE INDEX node_events_errors_op_key_idx ON node_events_errors (operation_key);



I'd recommend rollback the DB snapshot to 7.5.8 and upgrading to 7.27.10 again.

In DB snapshot, if you see that groups table is empty and manually drop the table (e.g  drop table groups; ) before upgrading 7.27.10 to avoid the initial syntax error as follows.

we run out of connections in our connections pool that is why I ask.

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for contacting JFrog Support.

With regards to remote docker registry issue, we believe that its priority should be set to 'high'. The 'critical' status is used for situations where production systems are down. We will continue to address this case with the appropriate attention.

Please provide us the reverse proxy configuration & Artifactory support bundle.

We've successfully ran the queries on both our dev and qa instances and tested with a few users which appear to be working. However, I still have a question concerning the importing of the service accounts. I now see some of the service accounts. How can I get a comparison of the list of service accounts in both our old and new QAs.

Hello Paul,

  As discussed in the session today, user already exits will not be able to access the profile page even if you turn on the settings in LDAP settings. The only way to do this is by editing users settings ( we should avoid deleting the user as it will force a new apikey ). However, it's not feasible for the scope of all users.

  To do this, we first tired to export user access data and modify the updatable_profile. However, the import process seems to be sticking or talking a long time.

  A faster way would be to make direct changes to the database. As discussed, please take a db snapshot and ask your DBA to perform the following query:


SELECT user_id,prop_key,prop_value FROM access_users_custom_data as o where o.prop_key = 'updatable_profile';

UPDATE access_users_custom_data SET prop_value = true where prop_key='updatable_profile';
  Let us know if your user can access profile pages after this. Thank you.

Best regards,
Paul Pan

please find the attached files here:

ref:_00D20M3v0._500693utgWo:refTrue2021-12-01T22:28:19.000+000002s6900002S4BWpAAN5006900003YgF1AAAVRe: [#183333] Getting manifest unknown: The named manifest is not known to the registry error when trying to pull images from Dockerhub via ArtifactoryHello Akash,

Please find my answers below.
1. Yes you can place the configuration file in that location. The proxy pass does not look correct. To confirm, these nginx instances are installed in the same instance as the Artifactory instance correct? If this is the case you can just use localhost for the proxy pass otherwise it will be trying to reach out to "http://artifactory-ha.bcbsfl.com".

Are you looking to not use your current load balancer anymore and are replacing it with an Nginx service? If this is the case you will only need one Nginx node.

If you are adding the Nginx nodes in addition to keeping the load balancer this may not solve the issue because as mentioned in our previous call there is most likely something in the Load Balancer that is not sending authentication properly.
If you still have a separate load balancer and are using Nginx for each Artifactory node you may remove this section.

## add HA entries when ha is configure
upstream artifactory {
server 10.8.75.245:8082;
server 10.8.65.72:8082;
}
upstream artifactory-direct {
server 10.8.75.245:8081;
server 10.8.65.72:8081;
}

And to confirm since you have configured 8080; your load balancer is pointing to each of these nodes at 8080? For example, the LB is redirecting the URL from  "http://artifactory-ha.bcbsfl.com" to 10.8.75.245:8080 (if the LB chooses this node).


2. No restart is needed for Artifactory.

3. Test the URL to see if everything is working as expected.

4&5. For Nginx you do not need to use HTTPS/SSL if SSL termination is occurring in the LoadBalancer. If you are replacing the LoadBalancer with Nginx, yes, you will need to use HTTP and SSL with Nginx and it will be using the certificate and key for "https://artifactory-ha.bcbsfl.com".

6. The default Nginx template will redirect requests with /artifactory in it to 8081.

7. No change is needed on Artifactory's side as you are using repository path. If you are replacing the LB with Nginx you will have to add port 8080 to the URL since you configured it that way.

8. Go ahead and schedule a session with me using the following link.

1
See if there is a file: access.config.import.yml in <JFROG_HOME>/var/etc/access directory. If so, set TLS flag to false.

tls: false # When set to true, JFrog Access will act as the Certificate Authority (CA) and sign the TLS certificates used by all the different JFrog Platform nodes. This ensures that the node to node communication is done over TLS.


2
Disable if the following is set in system.yaml in <JFROG_HOME>/var/etc directory

## TLS settings
  tls:
    ## If true will allow self signed certificates for tls
    #skipVerifyCertificate: false



3
Restart Artifactory, this should turn TLS/SSL off. Then, try accessing Artifactory URL directly using http://<Artifactory_Host_IP>:<port>/ui (Default UI port: 8082) instead of your Apache front-end IP/DNS.

Thanks and hope you had a good break as well.
We rolled out the socket timeout change to the 'python-pypi-remote' repo, reducing it down from 15seconds to 7.5seconds as per your last recommendation.
As the traffic picked up at our end (the TG break was relatively quiet), we did see an issue again in production. This time no nodes went unhealthy, but we saw a lot of upload/PUT requests met with 5xx response codes. Prompting complains from our customers.
The issue was seen between 12:52pm and 13:48pm PST today (12/1). A lot of the errors in the logs are regarding binary provider. I am uploading the support bundle shortly, please do advise.

I am a member of the CTI team at Roku. We were just concerned about the scaling of RabitMQ of whether what should be the minimum replica count to be able to handle huge workloads in production.
What we got to know so far is that we cannot increase the persistence size of RabbitMQ beyond 20Gi and that's our biggest concern. Even when we try to deploy it with a higher memory, it gives us this error:Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "xray-ha-rabbitmq" with kind StatefulSet: StatefulSet.apps "xray-ha-rabbitmq" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', and 'updateStrategy' are forbidden

We are running on K8's and would like to have the minimum amount of repilca count so we are good on our production workloads.

I am unsure if the next major release will be 7.30 as there is no eta. However, 7.28.9 is released (but only as a cloud version). Based on this, I suspect there will be a 7.29 as well. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

It shouldn't be a fixed throughput for downloading. While I investigate further on this on our end, can you provide me with the following:

Is there a proxy or firewall within your organization that can interfere the network speed?
Is this happening all across your machines?

This issue seems to be resolved now. All I did was deleted the artifactory PVC and all pods. When the deployment spined up the new pods and PVC again, I had no issues as such which I was having earlier. There is only one thing though, after the import the XRAY still points to the older version, which can also be seen in the videos I shared.

So just 2 questions:

  *   Do you think, what I did was correct (deleted the PVC and pods to resolved the issue)
  *   How do I fix the XRAY version (previous one had an older one, and now I am deploying a new version)

With Regards,
Farhaan.

Can you please ask your user the verify the checksum of the zip files uploaded or retry the upload? You can also try to split the zip files into smaller chucks:

zip existing.zip --out new.zip -s 500m

It's a known issue that happens in particular with Artifactory. See the specific comment here: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/9886
3.6.0 - works for 443 and not 443,, this is last known working version3.6.1 - both 443 and not 443 both fail! This is where the issue first fails3.6.2 - 443 works, not 443 fails. This is the same thing we see on latest
The issue seems to be because when you run the helm index, it's returning urls that always put in :443. Even if the repo add did not include :443. This causes problems because helm is treating it as a different domain and will not send credentials to prevent leaks. The insecure work around is to use --pass-credentials when you do the helm pull. 
I would agree with the link above, that artifactory should not be adding :443 to the index if it wasn't added in the repo add. This may be fixed in helm, though it might take some time. But if it's not fixed there, I would consider this a bug in artifactory.

Thank you for your efforts - really appreciate it.I think we are so far clear how we need to proceed regarding the point 2) - archive searches. Internally we will discuss on monitoring and eventually disabling this feature, if not required by end users.Regarding the point 1) you have clarified that using zip archives will not generate more load on DB side (neither create more data, nor cost large number of queries during download of containing files).Maybe I was not completely clear during our session, what I would like to know about the resource consumption difference, when using a zip archive (and downloading some files from it) instead of uncompressed, separately stored files... But you have now clarified the topic from the DB perspective. Still it is not clear to me how the resource consumption difference looks like from application server perspective.As per my understanding, if I have a zip file and the application stored it as single binary (checksum based) on the storage, but I need to download single files from it (or just simply want to browse its content), I suppose that the application server needs to open this whole binary (which can be a large one with several thousands of files) first from the storage and needs to either unzip the contained requested files to be able to serve it (or when a browsing request is triggered, the server has to query the big file for its content list - e.g. like "zipinfo -1 archive.zip" in the background). 
Can you explain, how much more costly (CPU/RAM on the Artifactory server) is this download of contained files from a big archive compared to the separately stored same files' download?
If the difference is negligible, we can get back to the customer and safely recommend the usage of compressed zip archives, instead of deploying millions of (mainly small) separate files. It will only have a positive effect on the overall resource consumption of the backend.
Thank you.Best regards,Kalman

I am a member of the CTI team at Roku. We are currently working on building out a multi region HA cluster in us-east and us-west and also working on a script to create automation users. The question here was that all the repos in both the cluster's are in Sync (push replication), so if we create a user in us-east, is there any way it would be available in us-west cluster or do we need to create the user with the same creds there manually?
Similarly, is there any mechanism where we can create a user only once and will be available in both the cluster so all the users are always in sync?
Hoping to hear from you soon.
With Regards,Farhaan.

You will not see errors in logs with this change. multiReadEnabled just controls how many threads are used to download from the next provider ( S3 or NFS ) to cache. You might see a slight performance impact when files are downloaded from nfs to cache. However, we are talking about a rare case when you have multiple download requests for the same file when it's cached for the first time. Please note that you want to increase your cache-fs size with this change, because the default size is not good enough for your usage and you want to avoid frequent changes to cache in general. Thank you.

Thank you for meeting with me today.
During the session, we have looked at the issue where a non-admin LDAP user added another LDAP user in Artifactory.
From the logs, the user "aj39264" first was logged through the "NPM login" process. But soon after, the user was created through another LDAP user who doesn't have admin privilege.

2021-11-09T01:48:09.101-0500|UNKNOWN      |rb45857 |jf-artifactory@08ceebb9-f61c-47b5-9ca8-38fef0400cf0|aj39264 |C|USR|{"added":{"allowedIps":"[*]","customData.disabled_password":"true","groups.readers":"UserGroupImpl(name=readers, realm=internal)","realm":"internal","email":"","status":"enabled","username":"aj39264"}}


I can confirm that when an LDAP user logs into Artifactory UI for the first time, it will be processed as "anonymous" to create an internal user. For example,

2021-12-01T23:17:22.784+0000|52.9.243.19|anonymous|jfrt@01fnw2zdjmcn760547qsea0byg|puser|C|USR|{"added":{"allowedIps":"[*]","customData.disabled_password":"true","groups.readers":"UserGroupImpl(name=readers, realm=internal)","realm":"internal","email":"","status":"enabled","username":"puser"}}

But it's still unclear how "aj39264" user got created through "rb45857" user's request.

I have received your Support Bundle. I will go through the logs and will run tests internally and will share my findings with you.

Thank you again for your time today. I will keep you posted.

Subject: [EXT] [#187452] Verifying repos have replicated fully.

Hi Russel,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

Please note that you can view not just the total size of the filestore, you can also check the size of the repositories that were replicated and compare them with the source instance (General tab --> "Artifact Count/Size" or in the Storage Summary under Admin module --> Monitoring).

One option to verify and compare the artifacts between source and target repositories is to use the below script (which I understand was shared with you by Hanan):

https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-scripts/tree/master/replicationDiff<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjfrog%2Fartifactory-scripts%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2FreplicationDiff&data=04%7C01%7Crussell.jackson%40nortonlifelock.com%7Cfdec4fecf93442e6e18308d9b4b1a5e3%7C94986b1d466f4fc0ab4b5c725603deab%7C0%7C0%7C637739497364976469%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=OMfmSixnTnHoMXofnPmbxwTwC1R7ulAmIb35W36%2BDK4%3D&reserved=0>

Lastly, in a similar way to the script above, there is the option to manually use the FileList REST API<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfrog.com%2Fconfluence%2Fdisplay%2FJFROG%2FArtifactory%2BREST%2BAPI%23ArtifactoryRESTAPI-FileList&data=04%7C01%7Crussell.jackson%40nortonlifelock.com%7Cfdec4fecf93442e6e18308d9b4b1a5e3%7C94986b1d466f4fc0ab4b5c725603deab%7C0%7C0%7C637739497364976469%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=5KIKofkxOLRxlq8YFUmyJRLheL%2Bx%2FP6yWXlw%2B%2BnLLUs%3D&reserved=0>  to get all files checksums of a repository and diff the results between source and target repositories, for example:

curl  -uadmin:password "http://localhost:8081/artifactory/api/storage/<REPO_NAME>/?list&deep=1&listFolders=0&mdTimestamps=1<http://localhost:8081/artifactory/api/storage/%3cREPO_NAME%3e/?list&deep=1&listFolders=0&mdTimestamps=1>"  | grep sha1

Will return a list with all the checksums of files in the repository and any discrepancy between source and target instances can be searched using the checksum search in Artifactory.


Let me know if I can further assist.

We previously opened a ticket 183193 on a DB Sync issue where every time our Xray instance does a DB Sync its RDS database would always run out of BurstBalance due to high IOPS consumption, and the JFrog staff at the time suggested to us that this is a known issue in that version of Xray (v 3.18.0), and upgrading to a version above v 3.23 would alleviate the problem. And we upgraded to v 3.34.1 about 3 weeks ago, though the DB Sync are consuming less resources, but it is still eating up a lot of BurstBalances (please view attached for our BurstBalance consumption for the past month). We are wondering if there is any other ways or settings that we can adjust to help this problem.

It contains the following files (primary-1 is the one having issues):

- primary-1_var_opt_jfrog_artifactory_log.tgz    # /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/log from primary-1 pod

Sorry it took a while.  IT simply had me reboot my laptop and that solved the remote desktop issue.

Adi,

I will try to get the support bundle from Primary-1.  I run into some issue with logging to the Kubernetes master node at the moment.

The NodePort config is due to the fact that the Kubernetes cluster underneath consists of VM instances in our own data center. We have no cloud load balancers in front of them.  What we have are Nginx servers that redirect traffic destined for a DNS name to the Kubernetes nodes at the port the Artifactory Nginx service bond to, e.g., 32008.

Hi Wei,

With respect to your questions

  *   In order to investigate it, please share with me the logs from Primary-1. (in the support bundle you shared, only the primary-0 logs are present)
  *   This is expected, if one instance is down, its license is considered not in use.
  *   This is expected, if the instance is down, its logs will not show in the UI. Regarding the message "Cannot read property ’data’ of undefined" please share with me the logs from Primary-1.
Furthermore, I have noticed that you have set the Nginx service type in the values.yaml file to 'NodePort', Are you running the cluster on Minikube? if not please remove this block



nginx:

  service:

    type: NodePort

2021-12-01T05:09:27.195Z [49d55647b9afcae9] [ACCEPTED DELETE] npm-online:@maccabi/m-ui/-/m-ui-63.5.44.tgz  for client : admin / 10.70.10.141.

which I believe correlates to this delete:

2021-12-01T05:10:58.734Z [jfmd ] [INFO ] [70b1eedbf5cc4808] [path_service.go:61            ] [main                ] - Deleting versions 1 for path @maccabi/m-ui/-/m-ui-63.5.44.tgz [path_service]

 

The same with the expect-26.6.2.tgz

2021-12-01T05:09:27.288Z [49d55647b9afcae9] [ACCEPTED DELETE] MaccabiOnline:expect/-/expect-26.6.2.tgz  for client : admin / 10.70.10.141.

correlating to:

Please let me know if you have any questions concerning this.

Hi Truc and SalesOps Team,

To help Nvidia with compliance,
- please reissue the bucket for 33 as a pair of buckets
- one for 9 and the other for 24

Please remove or blacklist the initial bucket for 33 that was sent.

Thanks for all your help on this.

Cheers.

Hi Support,



Our production licenses have expired and we received the new bucket licenses but need help applying the artifactory bucket licenses.



Please let us know support availability at the earliest possible slot.

Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. In our session, we were better able to show and understand the issue that is being faced - attempting to access the pctools sub-directory in the UI crashes the Chrome Artifactory tab with an 'Aw Snap' / Out of memory error. This sub-directory holds about 288,562 artifacts. Originally, it seemed that the 'Aw Snap' / Out of memory error that you were facing was a function of your Chrome browser. However, within the session, we saw that this type of behavior was not only happening when accessing the Artifactory 7 instance within the Chrome browser. We used Edge and it presented itself in the form of an error - "Maximum call stack size exceeded error". Something to note, Artifactory 6 did not have these issues when the directory was accessed in the UI.  I will work to reproduce this issue in my environment and I should be updating you no later than Friday, before the end of my day.

As I understand the question - you are looking for a way to check what artifacts have a particular vulnerability. If so, then some ways to do this are through the UI and through the REST API.  For the UI, you can check the Ancestors of a vulnerable package to see the artifacts that include or depend on the package.  For the REST API - you can use the Find Component by CVE REST API can also be used to get the components by the CVEs it contains.

As for the 'no comparable builds', I'd like to take a look at the builds within your Artifactory to better understand why.  We can schedule a session for us to see this action.  Please use this link to schedule the session, or let me know a time and I will schedule it and send the invite.

The issue is still being in the process of being reproduced by Prassanna and he will update you as soon as he is able.

I have taken a look at the Nginx configuration sent and the "fail_timeout" configuration appears to be quite low.
This setting according to Nginx documentation is:

the time during which the specified number of unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the server should happen to consider the server unavailable;

and the period of time the server will be considered unavailable.

This could mean that after it detects that the upstream node is down after 1 second it retrys that node again.

Could you try changing this configuration to 30 seconds and rerun the tests?

Hi Truc and SalesOps Team,



To help Nvidia with compliance,

- please reissue the bucket for 33 as a pair of buckets

- one for 9 and the other for 24



Please remove or blacklist the initial bucket for 33 that was sent.



Thanks for all your help on this.



Cheers.

I have checked the system.yaml file you have shared and noticed that "XRAY_CERT_FILE_PATH", "XRAY_CERT_KEY_FILE_PATH", and "XRAY_CA_CERT_FILE_PATH" file locations need to be switched.

shared:
    env:
        GODEBUG: "x509ignoreCN=0"
 XRAY_CERT_FILE_PATH: /opt/jfrog/xray/var/data/server/certs/ca-cert.crt XRAY_CERT_KEY_FILE_PATH: /opt/jfrog/xray/var/data/server/certs/client-cert.crt XRAY_CA_CERT_FILE_PATH: /opt/jfrog/xray/var/data/server/certs/client-key.pem

        clientCertKeyFilePath: /opt/jfrog/xray/var/data/server/certs/client-key.pem

Please modify as below,

        GODEBUG: "x509ignoreCN=0"
	XRAY_CERT_FILE_PATH: /opt/jfrog/xray/var/data/server/certs/client-cert.crt

        clientCertKeyFilePath: /opt/jfrog/xray/var/data/server/certs/client-key.pem

Please try to apply the above change and restart Xray.

If the issue persists, please share the Xray logs and updated system.yaml file.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

It seems pretty straightforward.I would like to know if changing the user email address is just an isolated settings change or if this can affect/disrupt the user connection to Artifactory.Please confirm.Thank you,Micaela Scuderi

Thank you for your detailed response on the 18th. This has been helpful in our investigation.
I've taken a look at the statistics you mentioned and they are as follows:
Storage: 53,992,424 binaries, 71,430,791 artifacts, and 95,409,435 total items. 395.26 TB Binaries, 441.53 TB of Artifacts.Throughput: Over the last 4 weeks we had Max: 146,835, Min: 13,785, Avg: 78,087 "ACCEPTED DEPLOY" events on the primary node of our cluster. 
A few new questions (no correlation to the numbers on our previous message)
Given this information, do you have any specific guidance for sizing requirements? I think we can use 70M artifacts and 80k artifacts/day as the current sizingWhat would you suggest if we grew to 100M artifacts and 150k artifacts/day?How would you suggest we monitor Xray to determine how many artifacts it is scanning per day?Is there an equivalent log to the artifactory "Accepted deploy" entry we can monitor to compare Xray throughput to Artifactory publishing?Thank you,
Palantir DevTools

The reason you need to up the storage is because the minimum storage requirements for Xray is 500gb, and it usually takes 200-300gb from the initial DB sync and other files (https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/System+Requirements).

To answer your questions:
1) Xray shouldn't be taking down Artifactory, can you send me the Artifactory logs when Artifactory went down as well as the Xray logs to see what was happening at the time?

2) Artifactory and Xray use separate databases, and in most cases Xray shouldn't be installed on the same machine as well since they would compete for resources and ports and can cause various issues. It is possible to set up a machine with multiple DBs so to hold Artifactory's DB as well as Xray's DB, but they are still separate and you need to make sure the machine has enough provisioned resources.

3) You can find this documentation here https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Creating+Xray+Policies+and+Rules
